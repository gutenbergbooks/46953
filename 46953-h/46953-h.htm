<h2 class="p2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The present is the first instance in which the history of any wine
has been traced with the same degree of minuteness as the history of
the still and sparkling wines of the Champagne has been traced in the
following pages. And not only have the author&rsquo;s investigations extended
over a very wide range, as will be seen by the references contained in
the footnotes to this volume, but during the past ten years he has paid
frequent visits to the Champagne&mdash;to its vineyards and vendangeoirs,
and to the establishments of the chief manufacturers of sparkling wine,
the preparation of which he has witnessed in all its phases. Visits
have, moreover, been made to various other localities where sparkling
wines are produced, and more or less interesting information gathered
regarding the latter. In the pursuit of his researches, the author&rsquo;s
position as wine juror at the Vienna and Paris Exhibitions opened up to
him many sources of information inaccessible to others less favourably
circumstanced, and these his general knowledge of wine, acquired during
many years&rsquo; careful study, enabled him to turn to advantageous account.</p>

<p>The numerous illustrations scattered throughout the present volume have
been derived from every available source that suggested itself. Ancient
<span class="smaller">MSS.</span>, early-printed books, pictures and pieces of sculpture,
engravings and caricatures, all of greater or less rarity, have been
laid under contribution; and in addition, nearly two hundred original
sketches have been made under the author&rsquo;s immediate superintendence,
with the object of illustrating the principal localities and their more
picturesque features, and depicting all matters of interest connected
with the growth and manipulation of the various sparkling wines which
are here described.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this work, and more particularly the historical
portions of it, the author has been largely assisted by his nephew, Mr.
Montague Vizetelly, to whom he tenders his warmest acknowledgments for

<p class="top3 drop-capi2">A<span class="smaller">LTHOUGH</span> the date of the introduction of the vine into France is lost in
the mists of antiquity, and though the wines of Marseilles, Narbonne,
and Vienne were celebrated by Roman writers prior to the Christian era,
many centuries elapsed before a vintage was gathered within the limits
of the ancient province of Champagne. Whilst the vine and olive throve
in the sunny soil of the Narbonnese Gaul, the frigid climate of the as
yet uncultivated North forbade the production of either wine or oil.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The &lsquo;forest of the Marne,&rsquo; now renowned for the vintage it yields, was
then indeed a dark and gloomy wood, the haunt of the wolf and wild boar,
the stag and the auroch; and the tall barbarians of Gallia Comata,
who manned the walls of Reims on the approach of Cæsar, were fain to
quaff defiance to the Roman power in mead and ale.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Though Reims
became under the Roman dominion one of the capitals of Belgic Gaul, and
acquired an importance to which numerous relics in the shape of temples,
triumphal arches, baths, arenas, military roads, &amp;c., amply testify; and
though the Gauls were especially distinguished by their quick adoption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of Roman customs, it appears certain that during the sway of the twelve
Cæsars the inhabitants of the present Champagne district were forced to
draw the wine, with which their amphoræ were filled and their pateræ
replenished, from extraneous sources. The vintages of which Pliny and
Columella have written were confined to Gallia Narboniensis, though the
culture of the vine had doubtless made some progress in Aquitaine and on
the banks of the Saône, when the stern edict of the fly-catching madman
Domitian, issued on the plea that the plant of Bacchus usurped space
which would be better filled by that of Ceres, led (<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 92) to
its total uprooting throughout the Gallic territory.</p>

</div>

<p>For nearly two hundred years this strange edict remained in force,
during which period all the wine consumed in the Gallo-Roman dominions
was imported from abroad. Six generations of men, to whom the cheerful
toil of the vine-dresser was but an hereditary tale, and the joys of
the vintage a half-forgotten tradition, had passed away when, in 282,
the Emperor Probus, a gardener&rsquo;s son, once more granted permission to
cultivate the vine, and even exercised his legions in the laying-out and
planting of vineyards in Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The culture was eagerly resumed, and,
as with the advancement of agriculture and the clearance of forests the
climate had gradually improved, the inhabitants of the more northern
regions sought to emulate their southern neighbours in the production
of wine. This concession of Probus was hailed with rejoicing; and some
antiquaries maintain that the triumphal arch at Reims, known as the Gate
of Mars, was erected during his reign as a token of gratitude for this
permission to replant the vine.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>By the fourth century the banks of the Marne and the Moselle were
clothed with vineyards, which became objects of envy and desire to the
yellow-haired tribes of Germany,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and led in no small degree to the
predatory incursions into the territory of Reims so severely repulsed
by Julian the Apostate and the Consul Jovinus, who had aided Julian to
ascend the throne of the Cæsars, and had combatted for him against the
Persians. Julian assembled his forces at Reims in 356, before advancing
against the Alemanni, who had established themselves in Alsace and
Lorraine; and ten years later the Consul Jovinus, after surprising
some of the same nation bathing their large limbs, combing their long
and flaxen hair, and &lsquo;swallowing huge draughts of rich and delicious
wine,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on the banks of the Moselle, fought a desperate and successful
battle, lasting an entire summer&rsquo;s day, on the Catalaunian plains near
Châlons, with their comrades, whom the prospect of similar indulgence
had tempted to enter the Champagne. Valerian came to Reims in 367 to
congratulate Jovinus; and the Emperor and the Consul (whose tomb is
to-day preserved in Reims Cathedral) fought their battles o&rsquo;er again
over their cups in the palace reared by the latter on the spot occupied
in later years by the church of St. Nicaise.</p>

For nearly half a century, it is
true, the vineyards of the Champagne throve amidst an era of quiet
and prosperity such as had seldom blessed the frontier provinces of
Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But when, in 406, the Vandals spread the flame of war from the
banks of the Rhine to the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the ocean, Reims was
sacked, its fields ravaged, its bishop cut down at the altar, and its
inhabitants slain or made captive; and the same scene of desolation was
repeated when the hostile myriads of Attila swept across north-western
France in 451.</p>

<p>Happier times were, however, in store for Reims and its bishops and its
vineyards, the connection between the two last being far more intimate
than might be supposed. When Clovis and his Frankish host passed through
Reims by the road still known as the Grande Barberie, on his way to
attack Syagrius in 486, there was no doubt a little pillaging, and the
famous golden vase which one of the monarch&rsquo;s followers carried off from
the episcopal residence was not left unfilled by its new owner. But
after Syagrius had been crushed at Soissons, and the theft avenged by
a blow from the king&rsquo;s battle-axe, Clovis not only restored the stolen
vase, and made a treaty with the bishop St. Remi or Remigius, son of
Emilius, Count of Laon, but eventually became a convert to Christianity,
and accepted baptism at his hands. Secular history has celebrated the
fight of Tolbiac&mdash;the invocation addressed by the despairing Frank to
the God of the Christians; the sudden rallying of his fainting troops,
and the last desperate charge which swept away for ever the power of
the Alemanni as a nation. Saintly legends have enlarged upon the piety
of Queen Clotilda; the ability of St. Remi; the pomp and ceremony which
marked the baptism of Clovis at Reims in December 496; the memorable
injunction of the bishop to his royal convert to adore the cross he
had burnt, and burn the idols he had hitherto adored; and the miracle
of the Sainte Ampoule, a vial of holy oil said to have been brought
direct from heaven by a snow-white dove in honour of the occasion. A
pigeon, however, has always been a favourite item in the conjuror&rsquo;s
paraphernalia from the days of Apolonius of Tyana and Mahomet down
to those of Houdin and Dr. Lynn; and modern scepticism has suggested
that the celestial regions were none other than the episcopal dovecot.
Whether or not the oil was holy, we may be certain that the wine which
flowed freely in honour of the Frankish monarch&rsquo;s conversion was
ambrosial; that the fierce warriors who had conquered at Soissons and
Tolbiac wetted their long moustaches in the choicest growths that had
ripened on the surrounding hills; and that the Counts and Leudes, and,
judging from national habits, the King himself, got royally drunk upon a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée réservée</i> from<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> the vineyard which St. Remi
had planted with his
own hands on his hereditary estate near Laon, or the one which the slave
Melanius cultivated for him just without the walls of Reims.</p>

<p>For the saint was not only a converter of kings, but, what is of
more moment to us, a cultivator of vineyards and an appreciator of
their produce. Amongst the many miracles which monkish chroniclers
have ascribed to him is one commemorated by a bas-relief on the north
doorway of Reims Cathedral, representing him in the house of one of
his relatives, named Celia, making the sign of the cross over an empty
cask, which, as a matter of course, immediately became filled with wine.
That St. Remi possessed such an ample stock of wine of his own as to
have been under no necessity to repeat this miracle in the episcopal
palace is evident from the will penned by him during his last illness
in 530, as this shows his viticultural and other possessions to have
been sufficiently extensive to have contented a bishop even of the most
pluralistic proclivities.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It is curious to note the connection between the spread of viticulture
and that of Christianity&mdash;a connection apparently incongruous, and yet
evident enough, when it is remembered that wine is necessary for the
celebration of the most solemn sacrament of the Church. Christianity
became the established religion of the Roman Empire about the first
decade of the fourth century, and Paganism was prohibited by Theodosius
at its close; and it is during this period that we find the culture of
the grape spreading throughout Gaul, and St. Martin of Tours preaching
the Gospel and planting a vineyard coevally. Chapters and religious
houses especially applied themselves to the cultivation of the vine, and
hence the origin of many famous vineyards, not only of the Champagne but
of France. The old monkish architects, too, showed their appreciation of
the vine by continually introducing sculptured festoons of vine-leaves,
intermingled with massy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
clusters of grapes, into the decorations of
the churches built by them. The church of St. Remi, for instance,
commenced in the middle of the seventh century, and touched up by
succeeding builders till it has been compared to a school of progressive
architecture, furnishes an example of this in the mouldings of its
principal doorway; and Reims Cathedral offers several instances of a
similar character.</p>

<p>Amidst the anarchy and confusion which marked the feeble sway of the
long-haired Merovingian kings, whom the warlike Franks were wont to
hoist upon their bucklers when investing them with the sovereign power,
we find France relapsing into a state of barbarism; and though the Salic
law enacted severe penalties for pulling up a vine-stock, the prospect
of being liable at any moment to a writ of ejectment, enforced by the
aid of a battle-axe, must have gone far to damp spontaneous ardour
as regards experimental viticulture. The tenants of the Church, in
which category the bulk of the vine-growers of Reims and Epernay were
to be classed, were best off; but neither the threats of bishops nor
the vengeance of saints could restrain acts of sacrilege and pillage.
During the latter half of the sixth century Reims, Epernay, and the
surrounding district were ravaged several times by the contending armies
of Austrasia and Neustria; and Chilperic of Soissons, on capturing the
latter town in 562, put such heavy taxes on the vines and the serfs
that in three years the inhabitants had deserted the country. Matters
improved, however, during the more peaceful days of the ensuing century,
which witnessed the foundation of numerous abbeys, including those of
Epernay, Hautvillers, and Avenay; and the planting of fresh vineyards
in the ecclesiastical domains by Bishop Romulfe and his successor St.
Sonnace, the latter, who died in 637, bequeathing to the church of St.
Remi a vineyard at Villers, and to the monastery of St. Pierre les Dames
one situate at Germaine, in the Mountain of Reims.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The sculptured

have been intended for one of these numerous wine-growing prelates.</p>

<p>The mighty figure of Charlemagne, overshadowing the whole of Europe at
the commencement of the ninth century, appears in connection with Reims,
where, begirt with paladins and peers, he entertained the ill-used Pope
Leo III. right royally during the &lsquo;festes de Noel&rsquo; of 805. The monarch
who is said to have clothed the steep heights of Rudesheim with vines
was not indifferent to good wine; and the vintages of the Champagne
doubtless mantled in the magic goblet of Huon de Bordeaux, and brimmed
the horns which Roland, Oliver, Doolin de Mayence, Renaud of Montauban,
and Ogier the Dane, drained before girding on their swords and starting
on their deeds of high emprise&mdash;the slaughter of Saracens, the rescue
of captive damsels, and the discomfiture of felon knights&mdash;told in the
fables of Turpin and the &lsquo;chansons de geste.&rsquo; That the cultivation
of the grape, and above all the making of wine, had been steadily
progressing, is clear from the fact that the distinction between the
&lsquo;Vins de la Rivière de Marne&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Vins de la Montagne de Reims&rsquo;
dates from the ninth century.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>This era is, moreover, marked by the inauguration of that long series
of coronations which helped to spread the popularity of the Champagne
wines throughout France by the agency of the nobles and prelates taking
part in the ceremony. Sumptuous festivities marked the coronation of
Charlemagne&rsquo;s son Louis in 816; and the officiating Archbishop Ebbon
may have helped to furnish the feast with some of the produce from
the vineyard he had planted at Mont Ebbon, generally identified with
the existing Montebon, near Mardeuil. It is of this vineyard that
Pardulus, Bishop of Laon, speaks in a letter addressed by him to Ebbon&rsquo;s
successor, the virtuous Hincmar, who assumed the crozier in 845,
proffering him counsels as to the best method of sustaining his failing
health. After telling him to avoid eating fish on the same day that it
is caught, insisting that salted meat is more wholesome than fresh, and
recommending bacon and beans cooked in fat as an excellent digestive,
he proceeds: &lsquo;You must make use of a wine which is neither too strong
nor too weak&mdash;prefer, to those produced on the summit of the mountain
or the bottom of the valley, one that is grown on the slopes of the
hills, as towards Epernay, at Mont Ebbon; towards Chaumuzy, at Rouvesy;
towards Reims, at Mersy and Chaumery.&rsquo; The Champagne vineyards suffered
grievously from the internal convulsions which marked the period when
the sceptre of France was swayed by the feeble hands of the dregs of the
Carlovingian race. The Normans, who threatened Reims and sacked Epernay
in 882, swept over them like devouring locusts; and their annals during
the following century are written in letters of blood and flame.</p>

<p>Times were indeed bad for the peaceful vine-dressers in the tenth
century, when castles were springing up in every direction; when might
made right, and the rule of the strong hand alone prevailed; and when
the firm belief that the end of the world was to come in the year 1000
led men to live only for the present, and seek to get as much out of
their fellow-creatures as they possibly could. Such natural calamities
as that of 919, when the wine-crop entirely failed in the neighbourhood
of Reims, were bad enough; but the continual incursions of the
Hungarians, whose arrows struck down the peasant at the plough and the
priest at the altar, and the memory of whose pitiless deeds yet survives
in the term &lsquo;ogre;&rsquo; the desperate contest waged for ten years by
Heribert of Vermandois to secure the bishopric of Reims for his infant
son, during which hardly a foot of the disputed territory remained
unstained by blood; the repeated invasions of Otho of Germany; and the
struggle between Hugh Capet and Charles of Lorraine for the titular
crown of France,&mdash;left traces harder to be effaced. Reims underwent four
sieges in about sixty years; and Epernay, that most hapless of towns,
was sacked at least half a score of times, and twice burnt, one of the
most conscientiously executed pillagings being that performed in 947
by Hugh the Great, who, as it was vintage-time, completely ravaged the
whole country, and carried off all the wine.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Under the rule of the Capetian race matters improved as regarded foreign
foes, though the archbishops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
had in the early part of the eleventh
century to abandon Epernay, Vertus, Fismes, and their dependencies to
the family of Robert of Vermandois, who had assumed the title of Counts
of Champagne, to be held by them as fiefs. The fame of the schools of
Reims, where future popes and embryo emperors met as class-mates; the
festive gatherings which marked the coronation of Henry I. and Philip
I.; the great ecclesiastical council held by Leo IX., which procured
for the city the nickname of &lsquo;little Rome;&rsquo; and the growing importance
of the Champagne fairs, the great meeting-places throughout the Middle
Ages of the merchants of Spain, Italy, and the Low Countries,&mdash;favoured
the prosperity of the district and the production of its wine. Urban
II., a native of Châtillon, who wore the triple crown from 1088 to the
close of the century, was, prior to his elevation to the chair of St.
Peter, a canon of Reims, under the name of Eudes or Odo, and, tippling
there in company with his fellow-clerics, acquired a taste for the wine
of Ay, which he preferred to all others in the world.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Pilgrims to
Rome found penance light and pardon easily obtained when they bore with
them across the Alps, in addition to staff and scrip, a huge &lsquo;leathern
bottel&rsquo; of that beloved vintage which warmed the pontiff&rsquo;s heart and
whetted his wit for the delivery of those soul-stirring orations at
Placentia and Clermont, wherein he appealed to the chivalry of Western
Europe to hasten to the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre from the hands of
the infidel.</p>

</div>

<p>The result of these appeals was felt by the vine-cultivators of the
Champagne in more ways than one, and their case recalls that of the
petard-hoisted engineer. The virtuous, the speculative, and the
enthusiastic who followed Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless
to the plains of Asia Minor suffered at the hands of the vicious, the
prudent, and the practical, who remained at home and passed their time
in pillaging the estates of their absent neighbours. The abbatial
vineyards suffered like the others; and the monks of St. Thierry,
in making peace with Gerard de la Roche and Alberic Malet in 1138,
complained bitterly of wine violently extorted during two years from
growers on the ecclesiastical estate and of a levy made upon their
vineyard.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The efforts of Henry of France, a warlike prelate, who built fortresses
and attacked those of the robber-nobles, and of Louis VII., who avenged
the wrongs of the church of Reims on the Counts of Roucy, served to
improve matters; and we may be sure that whenever the monks did get
hold of a repentant or dying sinner, they made him pay pretty dearly
for peace with them and Heaven. Colin Musset, the early Champenois
poet, thought that the best use to which money could be put was to
spend it in good wine.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Churchmen, however, managed to secure the
desired commodity without any such outlay, for numerous charters of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries show lords, sick or about starting for
the crusades, making large gifts to abbeys and monasteries; and many a
strip of fair and fertile vineland was thus added, thanks to a judicious
pressure on the conscience, to the already extensive possessions of the
two great monasteries of Reims, St. Remi and St. Nicaise, and also to
that of St. Thierry. The Templars, too, whose reputation as wine-bibbers
was only inferior to that of the monks, if we may credit the adage which
runs,</p>

<p>and who, prior to the catastrophe of 1313, had a commandery at Reims,
possessed either vineyards, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droits de vinage</i>,
at numerous spots,
including Epernay, Hermonville, Ludes, and Verzy; while the separate
community of these &lsquo;Red Monks&rsquo; installed at Orilly had estates at Ay,
Damery, and Mareuil. The hospital of St. Mary at Reims also reckoned
amongst its possessions vineyards at Moussy, bequeathed by Canon Pontius
and Tebaldus Papelenticus. The wine, which in 1215 the treasurer of the
chapter of Reims Cathedral obtained from that body an acknowledgment of
his right to on the anniversaries of the deaths of Bishops Ebalus and
Radulf, and that to which the sub-treasurer and carpenter were severally
entitled, was no doubt in part derived from the vineyard planted in 1206
by Canon Giles at the Porte Mars and bequeathed by him to the chapter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

<p>These ecclesiastical topers, as a rule, were sufficiently critical of
the quality of the liquor meted out to them, and an agreement respecting
the dietary of the Abbey of St. Remi, at Reims, drawn up in 1218 between
the Abbot Peter and a deputation of six monks representing the rest of
the brethren, provides that the wine procured for the latter should be
improved by two-thirds of the produce of the Clos de Marigny being set
apart for their exclusive use. Ten years later, to put a stop to further
complaints on the part of these worthy rivals of Rabelais&rsquo; Frère Jean
des Entonnoirs, Abbot Peter was fain to agree that two hundred hogsheads
of wine should be annually brought from Marigny to the abbey to quench
the thirst of his droughty flock, and that if the spot in question
failed to yield the required amount the deficiency should be made up
from his own private and particular vineyards at Sacy, Villers-Aleran,
Chigny, and Hermonville.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The monks were in the habit of throwing open their monasteries to all
comers, under pretext of letting them taste the wine they had for sale,
until, in 1233, an ecclesiastical council at Beziers prohibited this
practice on account of the scandal it created. Petrarch has accused the
popes of his day of persisting in staying at Avignon when they could
have returned to Rome, simply on account of the goodness of the wines
they found there. Some similar reasons may have led to the selection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of Reims, during the twelfth century, as a place for holding great
ecclesiastical councils presided over by the sovereign pontiff in

<p>The kings of France may have preferred the wines of the Orleanais and
the Isle of France, and the monarchs of England have been content to
vary the vintages of their patrimony of Guienne with an occasional
draught of Rhenish; but the wines of the river Marne certainly found
favour at Troyes, where the Counts of Champagne, to whom Epernay had
been ceded as a fief, held a court little inferior in state to that of a
sovereign prince. The native vintage mantled in the goblets and beakers
that graced the board where they sat at meat amidst their knights and
barons, whilst minstrels sang and jongleurs tumbled and glee-maidens
danced at the lower end of the hall. It fired the fancy of the poet
Count Thibault, to whom tradition has ascribed the introduction of
the Cyprus grape into France on his return from the Crusades,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
helped the flow of the amorous strains which he addressed to Blanche of

<p>in return for their rhymes. It was this wine that the gigantic John Lord
of Joinville, Seneschal of Champagne under Thibault, and chronicler of
the Seventh Crusade, was in the habit of consuming warm and undiluted,
by the advice of his physicians, on account, as he himself mentions,
of his &lsquo;large head and cold stomach;&rsquo; a practice which seems to have
scandalised that pious and ascetic monarch St. Louis, who was careful
to temper his own potations with water. The king was most likely not
unacquainted with the wine, as a roll of the expenses incurred at
his coronation at Reims, in 1226, shows that 991 livres were spent
in wine on that occasion, when, in consequence of the vacancy of the
archiepiscopal see, the crown was placed upon his head by Jacques de
Bazoche, Bishop of Soissons.</p>

<p>Henry of Andelys, a compatriot of the engineer Brunel, who flourished,
if a poet can be said to flourish, in the latter half of the thirteenth
century, has extolled the wines of Epernay and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Hautvillers, and
mentioned that of Reims, in his poem entitled the &lsquo;Bataille des Vins.&rsquo;
He informs us at the outset that &lsquo;the great King Philip Augustus,&rsquo;
whom state records prove to have had a score of vineyards in different
parts of France,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> was very fond of &lsquo;good white wine.&rsquo; Anxious to
make a choice of the best, he issued invitations to all the most
renowned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crûs</i>, French and foreign, and forty-six different vintages
responded to this appeal; amongst them Hautvillers and Epernay,
described as &lsquo;vin d&rsquo;Auviler&rsquo; and &lsquo;vin d&rsquo;Espernai le Bacheler.&rsquo; The

resulting in the summary rejection of many competitors, till at length,
as Argenteuil&mdash;&lsquo;clear as oil&rsquo;&mdash;and Pierrefitte are disputing as to their

<p>The vintages of the then little kingdom of France put in a counter-claim
for finesse and flavour as opposed to strength, and maintain that they
do not harm those who drink them. The dispute becomes general, and the
wines, heated with argument, exhale a perfume of &lsquo;balsam and amber,&rsquo;
till the hall where they are met resembles a terrestial paradise. The
chaplain, after conscientiously tasting the whole of them, formally
excommunicated with bell, book, and candle all the beer brewed in
England and Flanders, and then went incontinently to bed, and slept for
three days and three nights without intermission. The king thereupon
made an examination himself, and named the wine of Cyprus pope, and that
of Aquilat<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> cardinal, and created of the remainder three kings, five
counts, and twelve peers, the names of which, unfortunately, have not
been preserved.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2 bottom2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> coronations at Reims served, as already remarked, to attract within
the walls of the old episcopal city all that was great, magnificent, and
noble in France. The newly-crowned king, with that extensive retinue
which marked the monarch of the Middle Ages; the great vassals of the
crown scarcely less profusely attended; the constable, the secular and
ecclesiastical peers, and the host of knights and nobles who assisted
on the occasion, were wont at the conclusion of the ceremony to hold
high revelry in the spacious temporary banqueting-hall reared near the
cathedral. It is to be regretted that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menus</i> of these banquets have
not been handed down to us in their entirety; but a few fragmentary
excerpts show that from a comparatively early period there was no lack
of wine, at any rate. A remonstrance addressed to Philip the Fair,
after his coronation in 1286, by the archbishop and burghers, asks that
they may be relieved of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
certain proportion of the sum levied on them
for the cost of the ceremony, on the ground that there still remained
over for the king&rsquo;s use no less than seven score tuns of wine from
the banquet. Some idea may be formed of the quantity of wine brought
regularly into the city from the circumstance of the king having Reims
surrounded by walls in 1294, and levying a duty on the wine imported
to pay for them, and by the value attached to the &lsquo;rouage&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of the
Mairie St. Martin, claimed by the chapter of Reims Cathedral in 1300.</p>

<p>At the coronation of Charles IV., in 1322, wine flowed in rivers.
Amongst the unconsumed provisions returned by the king&rsquo;s pantler, Pelvau
dou Val, to the burghers, &lsquo;vin de Biaune et de Rivière&rsquo;&mdash;that is, of
Beaune and of the Marne&mdash;figures for a value of 384 livres 5 sols 2
deniers.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The arrangements of the coronation had been intrusted to
the minister of finances, Pierre Remi, who certainly played the part of
the unjust steward. In the first place, he made the cost of the ceremony
amount to 21,000 livres, whereas none of his predecessors had spent more
than 7,000 livres. His opening move had been to seize upon the greater
part of the corn and all the ovens in Reims &lsquo;for the king&rsquo;s use,&rsquo; and
to sell bread to the townsfolk and visitors at his own price for a
fortnight prior to the coronation. After the ceremony he appropriated
in like manner all the plate and napery, and all the cooking utensils
and kitchen furniture, together with whatever had been left over, in the
shape of wine, wax, fish, bullocks, pigs, and similar trifles. The wine
thus taken was estimated at 1500 livres, part of which he sold to two
bourgeois of Reims, and kept the rest, together with forty-four out of
the fifty muids, or hogsheads, of salt provided.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Retributive justice
overtook him, for the chronicler of his ill-doings chuckles over the
fact that he was hanged as high as Haman on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
gibbet he had himself
erected at Paris. Things went off better at the coronation of King
Philip, in 1328, when the total amount expended in the three hundred
poinçons of the wine of Beaune, St. Pourçain, and the Marne consumed
was 1675 livres 2 sols 3 deniers.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Part of this flowed through the
mouth of the great bronze stag before which criminals condemned by the
archiepiscopal court used to be exposed, but which at coronation times
was placed in the Parvis Notre Dame, and spouted forth the &lsquo;claré dou
cerf,&rsquo; for the preparation of which the town records show that the
grocer O. la Lale received 16 livres.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The importance of the wine-trade of Reims at the commencement of the
fourteenth century is evidenced by the fact of there being at this epoch
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courtiers de vin</i>, or wine-brokers, the right of appointing whom rested
with the eschevins&mdash;a right which, vainly assailed by the archbishop in
1323, was confirmed to the municipal power by several royal decrees.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The burghers of Reims were fully cognisant of the merits of their
wine, and certainly spared no trouble to make others acquainted with
them. When the eschevins dined with the archbishop in August 1340 they
contributed thirty-two pots of wine as their share of the repast, in
addition to sundry partridges, capons, and rabbits. All visitors to the
town on business, and all persons of distinction passing through it,
were regaled with an offering of from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
two to four gallons from the
cellars of Jehan de la Lobe, or Petit Jehannin, or Raulin d&rsquo;Escry, or
Baudouin le Boutellier, or Remi Cauchois, the principal tavern-keepers.
The provost of Laon, the bailli and the receveur of Vermandois, the
eschevins of Châlons, the Bishop of Coustances, Monseigneur Thibaut
de Bar, Monseigneur Jacques la Vache (the queen&rsquo;s physician), the
Archdeacon of Reims, and the &lsquo;two lords of the parliament deputed by
the king to examine the walls,&rsquo; were a few of the recipients of this
hospitality, which was also extended to such inferior personages as a
varlet of Verdun and the varlet of the eschevins of Abbeville.</p>

<p>Two &lsquo;flasks,&rsquo; purchased for threepence-halfpenny from Petit Jehannin,
served to warm the eloquence of Maistre Baudouin de Loingnis when he
pleaded for the town on the subject of the fortifications in 1345; and
when, in 1340, the Archbishop of Narbonne, the Bishop of Poitiers, and
sundry other dignitaries passed through Reims with heavy hearts on their
way to St. Omer, to negotiate a truce with Edward of England after the
fatal battle of Sluys, the municipality expended five shillings and
threepence in a poinçon of wine to cheer them on their way. There was
probably plenty to spare, since on the outbreak of hostilities with
England the town-crier had received one penny for making proclamation
that no one should remove any wine from the town during the continuance
of the contest. The advent of a messenger of Monseigneur Guillaume
Pinson, who brought &lsquo;closed letters&rsquo; to the eschevins informing them of
the invasion of King Edward, does not seem to have spoilt the digestion
of those worthy gentlemen, since they partook of their annual gift of
wine and their presentation lamb at Easter 1346; but there were sore
hearts in the old city when one Jenvier returned from Amiens with the
tidings that their best and bravest had fallen under the banner of John
de Vienne, their warlike prelate, on the field of Crécy. Perhaps to the
state of depression that followed is due the fact that there are no
records of festivities at the coronation of King John the Good in 1350,
though we find the citizens seeking two years later to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
propitiate the
evil genius of France, Charles the Bad of Navarre, by the gift of a
queue of wine costing five crowns.</p>

</div>

<p>During the frightful anarchy prevailing after the battle of Poitiers,
when the victorious English and the disbanded forces of France made
common cause against the hapless peasants, the fields and vineyards
of Reims remained uncultivated for three years,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and the people of
the archbishopric would have perished of hunger had they not been able
to get food and wine from Hainault. Despite the prohibitions of the
regent, the nobles pillaged the country around Reims and ravaged the
vineyards from June to August 1358, and the havoc they wrought exceeded
even that accomplished during the Jacquerie. Nor were matters improved
by the advent of the English king, Edward III., when, on the wet St.
Andrew&rsquo;s-day of 1359, he sat down before the town with his host, which
starved and shivered throughout the bitter and tempestuous winter,
despite the comfort derived from the &lsquo;three thousand vessels of wine&rsquo;
captured by Eustace Dabreticourt in &lsquo;the town of Achery, on the river of
Esne.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But the Rémois stood firm behind the fortifications reared by
Gaucher de Châtillon till the following spring, when the victor of Crécy
drew off his baffled forces, consoling them with the promise of bringing
them back during the ensuing vintage, and made a reluctant peace at
Bretigny.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Yet, though plague and famine in turn almost depopulated the city, the
importance of its vineyards augmented from this time forward. In 1361
the citizens, who had already been in the habit of granting &lsquo;aides&rsquo; to
the king out of the dues levied on the wine sold in the town, obtained
leave to impose an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">octroi</i> on wine, in order to maintain their
fortifications. Henceforward the connection between the wines and the
walls of Reims became permanent. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">octroi</i> was from time to time
renewed or modified in various ways by different monarchs; but their
decrees always commenced with a preliminary flourish concerning the
necessity of keeping the walls of so important a city in good order, and
the admirable opportunity afforded of so doing by the ever-increasing
prosperity of the trade in wine. Conspicuous amongst the few existing
fragments of the circuit of walls and towers with which Reims was
formerly begirt is the tower of which a view is here given.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The Rémois, although willing enough to tax themselves for the defence
of their city, submitted the reverse of cheerfully to the preliminary
levies of provisions, wines, meats, and other things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
necessary, made by
the king&rsquo;s &lsquo;maistres d&rsquo;hôtel&rsquo; for the coronation of Charles V., which
took place on the 19th May 1364, at a cost to the town of 7712 livres
15 sols 5 deniers parisis.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The citizens had, however, something to
gaze at for their money, if that were any consolation. The king and his
queen (Jeanne de Bourbon) were accompanied by King Peter of Cyprus;
Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia and Duke of Brabant; the Dukes of Burgundy
and Anjou; the Counts of Eu, Dampmartin, Tancarville, and Vaudemont,
and many other prelates and lords, who did full justice to the good
cheer provided for the great feasts and solemnities taking place during
the five days of the royal sojourn.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The crown, borne by Philip of
Burgundy, the king&rsquo;s youngest brother, having been placed upon Charles&rsquo;s
head by the Archbishop Jean de Craon, that prelate proceeded to smear
the royal breast and brow with what the irreverent Republicans of the
eighteenth century designated &lsquo;sacred pomatum,&rsquo; from the Sainte Ampoule
presented to him by the Bishop of Laon, amidst the enthusiastic applause
of nobles and prelates.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The great planting of vines in the Champagne district plainly dates from
the last quarter of the fourteenth century, at which epoch large exports
of wine to the provinces of Hainault and Flanders, and especially
to the ports of Sluys, are noted. In a list of the revenues of the
archbishopric of Reims, drawn up by Richard Pique towards 1375, are
included patches of vineland and annual payments of wine from almost
every village and hamlet within twenty miles of Reims; though it is
only fair to mention that many of the places enumerated produce to-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
wines of very ordinary character, which, although they have a local
habitation, have certainly failed to secure themselves a name.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> A
general return of church property made to the Bailli of Vermandois, the
king&rsquo;s representative in 1384, at a time when Charles VI. was busily
engaged in confiscating whatever he could lay hands on, shows that
the religious establishments of Reims were equally well endowed with
vineyards. These were mostly situate to the north-east and south-west
of Reims, or in the immediate vicinity of the city; and according to
their owners, whose object was of course to offer as few temptations
as possible to the monarch, they frequently cost more to dress than
they brought in.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In the return furnished by the archbishop in the
following year, he complains that, owing to the great plantation of
vines throughout the district, the right of licensing the brewing of
ale and beer had failed to bring him in any revenue for the past three
years. This prelate, by the way, seems to have loved his liquor like
many of his predecessors, judging from the inventory made after his
death, in 1389, of the contents of his cellars.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> All this abundance
of wine was not without its fruits; and we find the clerk of Troyes
asserting that liars swarm in Picardy as drunkards do in Champagne,
where a man not worth a rap will drink wine every day;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and a boast
in the chanson of the Comte de Brie to the effect that the province
abounded in wheat, wine, fodder, and litter.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Under these circumstances it is not at all surprising that that renowned
vinous soaker, King Wenceslaus (surnamed the Drunkard) of Bohemia,
found ample opportunities for self-indulgence when he visited Reims to
confer with Charles VI. on the subject of the schism of the popes of
Avignon, then desolating the Church&mdash;certainly a very fit subject for
a drunkard and a madman to put their heads together about. No sooner
had the illustrious visitor alighted at the Abbey of St. Remi&mdash;to-day
the Hôtel Dieu&mdash;where quarters had been assigned him, than he expressed
a wish to taste the wine of the district, with the quality of which
he had long been acquainted. The wine was brought, and tasted again
and again in such conscientious style that when the Dukes of Bourbon
and Berri came to escort him to dinner with the king they found him
dead-drunk and utterly unfit to treat of affairs of State, still less
those of the Church. The same kind of thing went on daily&mdash;the &lsquo;same old
drunk,&rsquo; as the nigger expressed it, lasting week after week; and the
French monarch, who must have surely had a lucid interval, resolved to
profit by his guest&rsquo;s weakness. Accordingly he gave special orders to
the cup-bearers, at a grand banquet at which matters were to be finally
settled, to be particularly attentive in filling the Bohemian king&rsquo;s
goblet. This they did so frequently that the royal sot, overcome by
wine, yielded during the discussion following the repast whatever was
asked of him; whilst his host probably returned special thanks to St.
Archideclin, the supposed bridegroom of the marriage of Cana, whom the
piety of the Middle Ages had transformed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
 into a saint and created the
especial patron of all appertaining to the cellar. This triumph of wine
over diplomacy occurred in 1397.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>A charter of Charles VI., dated July 1412, which gave the municipal
authorities of Reims the sole right of appointing sworn wine-brokers,
expressly mentions that the trade of the town was chiefly based upon
the wine grown in the environs.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The wine, the charter states, when
stored in the cellars of the town, was customarily sold by brokers, who
of their own authority were in the habit of levying a commission of
twopence, and even more, per piece, selling it to the person who offered
them most, and taking money from both buyer and seller. To remedy this
state of things, from which it was asserted the trade had begun to
suffer, it was decreed that every broker should take an oath, before the
Captain of Reims and the eschevins, to act honestly and without favour,
and not to receive more than one penny commission. In the case of his
receiving more, both he and the seller of the wine were to forfeit
two-pence-halfpenny to the town.</p>

<p>The sales of wine mainly took place at the Etape aux Vins, where most of
the wine-merchants were established, the busiest time being during the
three great annual fairs, when no duties were levied. The old Etape aux
Vins is now the Rue de l&rsquo;Etape, jocularly styled the Rue de Rivoli of
Reims, on account of the arcades formed by the projecting upper floors
of its fifteenth-and sixteenth-century houses, which rest upon wooden
and stone pillars. To-day the casino and the principal restaurants of
the city are installed here; still the locality retains much the same
aspect as it presented in the days when Remi Cauchois and Huet Hurtaut
stood here and chaffered with the peasants who had brought their casks
of wine on creaking wains into the city; when S. de Laval glided in
search of a customer among the long-gowned fur-capped merchants of the
Low Countries; when bargains were closed by a God&rsquo;s-penny and wetted
with a stoup of Petit Jehannin&rsquo;s best; and when files of wine-laden
wagons rolled forth from the northern gates of the city to gladden the
thirsty souls of Hainault and Flanders.</p>

<p>Some of the wine had, however, a nobler destination. An order of payment
addressed by the town council to the receiver, and dated March 23, 1419,
commands him to pay Jacques le Vigneron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the sum of 78 livres 12 sols
for six queues of &lsquo;vin blanc et clairet,&rsquo; presented to the fierce Duke

Montereau.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The devastating results of the terrible struggle for
supremacy waged between the Armagnacs and Burgundians, and of the
invasion of Henry V. of England, are evidenced in the facts that when,
in fear and trembling, the Reims council resolved to allow Duke Philip
to enter the town in 1425, at the head of four thousand horse, they
could only offer him one queue of Beaune, one queue of red, and one
queue of white wine; and to the duchess the following year one queue of
Beaune and one of French wine; and that wine sent to l&rsquo;Isle Adam, at the
siege of Nesle, cost as much as 19 livres, or nearly 16&thinsp;<i>s.</i>, the queue.</p>

<p>Reims had passed under the sway of England by the Treaty of Troyes
in 1420, the Earl of Salisbury becoming governor of the Champagne.
The scarcity of wine, and the liking of the new possessors for their
national beverage, is shown by a prohibition issued by the town council
in 1427 against using wheat for making beer; and a statement of Gobin
Persin, that he had sold more treacle&mdash;a famous medicinal remedy in the
Middle Ages&mdash;during the past half year than in the four years previous,
owing to people complaining that they were swollen up from drinking
malt liquor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
The English, however, at their abrupt departure from the
city on the arrival of Charles and the Maid of Orleans, proved their
partiality for the wine of Reims by carrying off as many wagonloads of
it as they could manage to lay their hands on.</p>

<p>The gallant knights and patriot nobles who followed the Maid of Orleans
to Reims, and witnessed the coronation of Charles VII. in 1429,
despised, of course, the drink of their island foes, and moistened
throats grown hoarse with shouting &lsquo;Vive le roi&rsquo; with the choice vintage
of the neighbouring slopes, freely drawn forth from the most secret
recesses of the cellars of the town in honour of the glorious day. And
no doubt Dame Alice, widow of Raulin Marieu, and hostess of the Asne
royé (the Striped Ass), put a pot of the very best before the father of
&lsquo;Jehane la Pucelle,&rsquo; and did not forget, either, to score it down in the
little bill of twenty-four livres which she was paid out of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deniers
communs</i> for the old fellow&rsquo;s entertainment.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> For the next ten years,
however, the note of war resounded through the country, the hill-sides
bristled with lances in lieu of vine-stakes, and instead of money
spent for wine for presentation to guests of a pacific disposition,
the archives of the town display a long list of sums expended in
the purchase of arms, artillery, and ammunition, for the especial
accommodation of less pleasant visitors, in repairing fortifications,
and in payments to men charged with watching day and night for the
coming of the foe.</p>

<p>The excesses of the licentious followers of Potton de Xaintrailles and
Lahire were worse than those of the English and Burgundians, spite of
the four hundred and five livres which had been paid to men-at-arms
and archers from the neighbouring garrisons, &lsquo;engaged by the city of
Reims to guard the surrounding country, in order that the wine might be
vintaged and brought into the said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
city and the vineyards dressed,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
and bitter were the complaints addressed in 1433 to the king on the
falling off of the wine trade which had resulted therefrom. The ravages
of the terrible &lsquo;Escorcheurs&rsquo; led, in 1436, to fresh complaints and
to an additional duty on each queue of &lsquo;wine of Beaune, of the Marne,
and of other foreign districts&rsquo; sold wholesale at Reims, the receipts
to be spent in warlike preparations and on the fortifications. Some of
this went to Lahire as a recompense for defending the district from
&lsquo;the great routs and companies&rsquo; that sought to invade it, he having,
presumably on the principle of setting a thief to catch a thief,
been made Bailli of Vermandois. In troublous times like these it was
necessary to secure the good will of men in power and authority, and
hence the town records comprise numerous offerings of money, fine linen
cloths, and wine given to various nobles &lsquo;out of grace and courtesy&rsquo; for
their good will and &lsquo;good and agreeable services, pleasures, and love.&rsquo;
Madame Katherine de France (the widow of Henry V.), the Chancellor of
France, the Constable Richemont, Lahire (Bailli of Vermandois), the
bastard Dunois, the Archbishop of Narbonne, the Count de Vendôme, and
many other nobles and dignitaries, were in turn recipients of such
gifts; and the visit of King Charles the Victorious, in 1440, was
celebrated by their profuse distribution.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Despite the complete expulsion of the English from France, a depression
in trade still continued; and in 1451 the lieutenant of the town was
sent to court to complain that, owing to the exactions of the farmers of
the revenue, merchants would no longer come to Reims to buy wine. Louis
XI., who was crowned at Reims on 15th August 1461, entered the city in
great pomp, accompanied by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, and his son the
Count of Charolais, afterwards Charles the Bold; the Duke of Bourbon,
the Duke of Cleves, and his brother the Lord of Ravenstein, all three
nephews of Duke Philip; the Counts of St. Pol, Angoulême, Eu, Vendôme,
Nassau, and Grandpré; Messire Philip of Savoy, and many others,&mdash;&lsquo;all
so richly dressed that it was a noble sight to see,&rsquo; remarks Enguerrand
de Monstrelet. Prior to being crowned, the king handed his sword
to Duke Philip,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and requested the latter to bestow upon him the
honour of knighthood, which the duke did, and afterwards gave the
accolade to several other persons of distinction. The coronation,
with its accompaniment of &lsquo;many beautiful mysteries and ceremonies,&rsquo;
was performed by Archbishop Jean Juvénal des Ursins, assisted by the
Cardinal of Constance, the Patriarch of Antioch, a papal legate, four
archbishops, seventeen bishops, and six abbots. At its close the twelve
peers of France<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> dined at the king&rsquo;s table; and after the table
was cleared the Duke of Burgundy knelt and did homage for Burgundy,
Flanders, and Artois, other lords following his example.</p>

<p>Louis XI., on his accession, found himself in presence of an exhausted
treasury, and cast about for an expedient to fill it. The wine
he drunk at his coronation at Reims may have suggested the dues
which, only a month afterwards, he decreed should be levied on this
commodity, in conjunction with an impost on salt. The inhabitants
of the archiepiscopal city found it impossible to believe in such a
return for their wonted hospitality, and the vine-growers assailed the
collectors furiously. The affair resulted in a general outbreak, known
as the Mique-Maque, and in the final hanging, branding, mutilating,
and banishing of a number of individuals, half of whom, it may fairly
be presumed, were innocent. The wars between France and Burgundy were
also severely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
felt by the Rémois, whose territory was ravaged by the
followers of Charles the Bold after Montlhery, and who suffered almost
as much at the hands of their friends as at those of their foes. The
garrison put into the town shared amongst themselves the country for
a circuit of eight leagues, the meanest archer having a couple of
villages, whence he exacted, at pleasure, corn, wood, provisions, and
wine, the latter in such profusion that the surplus was sold in the
streets, the smallest allowance for each lance being a queue, valued at
ten livres, monthly. In 1470 and the following years large subsidies of
wine were, moreover, despatched from time to time to the king&rsquo;s army
in the field; a cartload being judiciously sent to General Gaillard,
&lsquo;as he is well disposed towards us, and it is necessary to cultivate
such people.&rsquo; Complaints made in 1489 set forth that in consequence of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">octroi</i> of the river Aisne, which had been established six years
previously, the merchants of Liège, Mezières, and Rethel, instead of
coming to Reims to buy wine, were obtaining their supplies from Orleans.
The landing of Henry VII. of England, in 1495, spread new alarms
throughout the Champagne, and orders were given for all the vine-stakes
within a radius of two leagues of Reims to be pulled up, so that the
enemy might be prevented from cooking provisions or filling up the moats
of the fortifications with them.</p>

<p class="bottom1">Pillaging foes and extortionate defenders were bad enough, but the
vine-growers had yet other enemies, to wit, certain noxious little
insects, which were in the habit of feeding on the young buds, though
there is no record that they were ever so troublesome at Reims as they
were in other parts of the Champagne, notably at Troyes, where on the
Friday after Pentecost 1516 they were formally and solemnly enjoined
by Maître Jean Milon to depart within six days from the vineyards of
Villenauxe, under pain of anathema and malediction.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> A century and a
half later these insects renewed their ravages, and were exorcised anew
by the rural dean of Sézanne, on the order of the Bishop of Troyes.</p>

<p>The close of the fifteenth century witnessed another coronation, that
of the so-styled &lsquo;Father of his People,&rsquo; Louis XII., celebrated with
all due splendour in May 1498. The six ecclesiastical peers&mdash;principal
among whom was the Cardinal Archbishop of Reims, Guillaume Briconnet,
in rochet and stole, mitre and crozier; and the six representatives of
the secular peerages, Burgundy, Normandy, Aquitaine, Flanders, Toulouse,
and Champagne&mdash;solemnly invested their sovereign with sword, spurs,
ring, orb, sceptre, crown, and all the other outward symbols of royalty;
whilst the vaulted roof rang with the acclamations of the people
assembled in the nave, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
triumphant peals from the heralds&rsquo;
silver trumpets, on the banneroles of which was emblazoned the monarch&rsquo;s
favourite badge, the hedgehog. Trumpet-blowing and shouting being both
provocative of thirst, peers and people did ample justice to the wine
freely provided for all comers on this occasion.</p>

<p>Francis I. was crowned at Reims in January 1515; and on the occasion
of his visiting the city sixteen years afterwards, twenty poinçons of
wine were offered to him and sixty to his suite, so that this bibulous
monarch had a good opportunity of comparing various growths of the
Mountain and the River with the wine from his own vineyards at Ay;
and possibly the Emperor Charles V. did his best to institute similar
comparisons on his self-invited incursion into the district in 1544.
For not only did these two great rivals, but also our own Bluff King
Harry and the magnificent Leo X., have each their special commissioner
stationed at Ay to secure for them the finest vintages of that favoured
spot, the renown of which thenceforward has never paled. The wine
despatched for their consumption was most likely sent direct from the
vineyards in carefully-sealed casks; but the bulk of the river growths
came to Reims for sale, and helped to swell the importance of the
town as an emporium of the wine-trade. When Mary Queen of Scots came
to Reims, a mere child, in 1550, four poinçons of good wine, with a
dozen peacocks and as many turkeys, were presented to her. There are no
records, however, of any further offerings to her when, as the widowed
queen of Francis II., she visited Reims at Eastertide in 1561, and again
during the summer of the same year, shortly before her final departure
from France. On these occasions she was the guest, by turns, of her
aunt Renée de Lorraine, at the convent of St. Pierre les Dames,&mdash;to-day
a woollen factory,&mdash;and of her uncle, the &lsquo;opulent and libertine&rsquo;
Charles de Lorraine, Cardinal and Archbishop of Reims, at the handsome
archiepiscopal palace, where this powerful prelate resided in unwonted
state. As the rhyme goes&mdash;</p>

<p>Brusquet, the court fool of Henry II., Francis II., and Charles IX.,
was a great favourite with this princely prelate, and accompanied him
several times on his embassies to foreign states.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Brusquet&rsquo;s wit was
much appreciated by the cardinal, and has been highly extolled by
Brantome; but most of the specimens handed down to us will not bear
repetition, much less translation, from their coarseness. When the
cardinal was at Brussels in 1559, negotiating the peace of Cateau
Cambresis with Philip II., Brusquet one day at dessert jumped on to the
table, and rolled along the whole length, wrapping himself up like a
mummy in the cloth, with all the knives, forks, and spoons, as he went,
and rolling over at the further end. The emperor, Charles V., who was
the host, was so delighted that he told him to keep the plate himself.
Brusquet had great dread of being drowned, and objected one day to go in
a boat with the cardinal. &lsquo;Do you think any harm can happen to you with
me, the pope&rsquo;s best friend?&rsquo; said the latter. &lsquo;I know that the pope has
power over earth, heaven, and purgatory,&rsquo; said Brusquet; &lsquo;but I never
heard that his dominion extended over water.&rsquo; It is not unlikely that
the effigy forming one of the corbels beneath the chapter court gateway,
and representing a fool in the puffed and slashed shoes and bombasted
hose of the Renaissance, with his bauble in his hand, may be intended
for Brusquet; for in the Middle Ages the ecclesiastical councils had
forbidden dignitaries of the Church to have fools of their own.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>It was in the grand hall of the archiepiscopal palace of Reims&mdash;an
apartment which is very little changed from the days when Charles
Cardinal de Lorraine entertained Henry II., Francis II., and Charles
IX. in succession&mdash;that the coronation banquets at this epoch used to

<p>The stock of wine at Reims at the period of Mary&rsquo;s first visit must have
been very low, owing to the continued requisitions of it for armies in
the field, for &lsquo;German reiters at Attigny,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Italian lansquenets
at Voulzy;&rsquo; and no doubt its production subsequently decreased to some
extent from the orders issued to the surrounding villagers to destroy
all their ladders and vats lest they should fall into the hands of the
enemy, at the epoch of the threatened approach of the German Emperor in
1552.</p>

<p>At the coronation of Francis II. in 1559, and at that of Charles IX.
(the future instigator of the massacre of St. Bartholomew) two years
later, the citizens of Reims presented the newly-crowned monarchs with
the customary gifts of Burgundy and Champagne wines.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In the latter
instance, however, the gift met with an unexpected return, inasmuch
as the king, after the fashion of Domitian, issued an edict in 1566,
ordering that vines should only occupy one-third of the area of a
canton, and that the remaining two-thirds should be arable and pasture
land. When the forehead of Henry III., the last of the treacherous race
of Valois, was touched with the holy oil by the Cardinal de Guise, the
wine of Reims for the first time was alone used to furnish forth the
attendant banquet, and the appreciative king modified his brother&rsquo;s
edict to a simple recommendation to the governors of provinces to see
that the planting of vines did not lead to a neglect of other labours.
During this reign the wine of Ay reached the acme of renown, and came to
be described as &lsquo;the ordinary drink of kings and princes.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In the troubles which followed the death of Henry III., when the east of
France was laid desolate in turn by Huguenots and Leaguers, Germans and
Spaniards; when Reims became a chief stronghold of the Catholics, who
formed a kind of Republic there, and the remaining towns and villages of
the district changed masters almost daily, the foragers of the party of
Henry of Navarre and that of the League caused great tribulation amongst
the vine-dressers and husbandmen of the Montagne and of the Marne.
In 1589 very little wine could be vintaged around Reims &lsquo;through the
affluence of enemies,&rsquo; dolefully remarks a local analist.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> After the
battle of Ivry, Reims submitted to the king, but many of the surrounding
districts, Epernay among the number, still sided with his opponents.
Epernay fell, however, in 1592, after a cruel siege; and in the autumn
of the same year the leaders of the respective parties met at the church
of St. Tresain, at Avenay, and agreed to a truce during the ensuing
harvest, in order that the crops of corn and wine might be gathered
in&mdash;a truce known as the Trève des Moissons. The yield turned out to be
of very good quality, the new wine fetching from 40 to 70 livres the
queue.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The system of cultivation prevailing in the French vineyards at this
epoch must have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
peculiar, since the staple agricultural authority
of the day states that, to have an abundant crop and good wine, all that
was necessary was for the vine-dresser to wear a garland of ivy, and for
crushed acorns and ground vetches to be put in the hole at the time of
planting the vine-shoots; that, moreover, grapes without stones could
be obtained by taking out the pith of the young plant, and wrapping the
end in wet paper, or sticking it in an onion when planting; that to get
grapes in spring a vine-shoot should be grafted on a cherry-tree; and
that wine could be made purgative by watering the roots of the vine with
a laxative, or inserting some in a cleft branch.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the still wine of the province of Champagne
was destined, like the setting sun, to gleam with well-nigh unparalleled
radiance up to the moment of its almost total eclipse. Continual care
and untiring industry had resulted in the production of a wine which
seems to have been renowned beyond all others for a delicate yet
well-developed flavour peculiarly its own, but of which the wonderful
revolution effected by the invention of sparkling wine has left but
few traces. In 1604 the yield was so abundant that the vintagers were
at their wits&rsquo; end for vessels to contain their wine; but three years
later so poor a vintage took place as had not been known within the
memory of man. During the winter the cold was so intense that wine froze
not only in the cellars, but at table close to the fire, and by the
ensuing spring it had grown so scarce that the veriest rubbish fetched
80 livres the queue at Reims.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In 1610, at the banquet following the
coronation of Louis XIII., the only wine served was that of Reims, at
175 livres, or about 7&thinsp;<i>l.</i>, the queue; and the future <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raffinés</i> of the
Place Royale who assisted at that ceremony were by no means the men to
forget or neglect an approved vintage after once tasting it. Champagne,
it has been said, was crowned at the same time with the king, and of
the two made a better monarch. Five years later a complaint, addressed
to the king on the subject of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermiers des aides</i> trying to levy
duties on goods sold at the fairs, asserted it was notorious that the
chief commerce of Reims consisted of wines. According to the police
ordinances of 1627, the price of these was fixed three times a year,
namely, at Martinmas, Mid-Lent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and Midsummer; and tavern-keepers
were bound to have a tablet inscribed with the regulation price fixed
outside their houses, and were not allowed to sell at a higher rate,
under a penalty of 12 livres for the first, and 24 livres for the second
offence. Moreover, to encourage the production of the locality, they
were strictly forbidden to sell in their taverns any other wine than
that of the &lsquo;cru du pays et de huit lieues es environs,&rsquo; under pain
of confiscation and a fine, the amount of which was arbitrary. The
vine-dressers too, in the same ordinances, were enjoined to kill and
burn all vine-slugs and other vermin, which during 1621 and the two
succeeding years had caused much damage.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>This rule must have been perforce relaxed during the troubles of the
Fronde, when for two years the troops of the Marshal du Plessis Praslin
lived as in a conquered country, indulging in drinking carousals in
the wine-shops of the towns, or marching in detachments from village
to village throughout the district, in order to prevent all those
who neglected to pay the contributions imposed from working in their
vineyards; when their leader, on the refusal of the Rémois to supply
him with money, ravaged the vineyards of the plains of les Moineaux and
Sacy; and when Erlach&rsquo;s foreigners at Verzy sacked the whole of the
Montagne from March until July 1650. As a consequence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
people in
the following year were existing on herbs, roots, snails, blood, bread
made of bran, cats, dogs, &amp;c., or dying by hundreds through eating
bread made of unripe wheat harvested in June; the ruin of the citizens
being completed, according to an eyewitness, at the epoch of dressing
the vines, owing to the lack of men to do the work.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> A contemporary
writer, however, asserts that the vineyards still continued &lsquo;to cover
the mountains and to encircle the town of Reims like a crown of
verdure;&rsquo; and that their produce not only supplied all local wants, but,
transported beyond the frontier, caused the gold of the Indies to flow
in return into the town, and spread its reputation afar.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Such was the repute of the Champagne wines when Louis XIV. was crowned
at Reims in 1654, that all the great lords present on the occasion were
exceedingly anxious to partake of them, and no doubt regarded with
envious eyes the huge basket containing a hundred bottles of the best
which the deputies from Epernay had brought with them as a present to
the gallant Turenne. He at least was no stranger to the merits of the
wine, for the records of Epernay show that many a caque had found its
way to his tent during the two preceding years, when he was defending
the Champagne against Condé and his Spanish allies. In the same year
(1654), the Procureur de l&rsquo;Echevinage speaks of the chief trade of Reims
as consisting in the sale of wine, of which the inhabitants collect
large quantities, both from the Montagne de Reims and the Rivière de
Marne, through the merchants who make this their special trade&mdash;a trade
sorely interrupted by the incursions of Montal and his Spaniards in
1657 and 1658. Guy Patin too, writing in 1666, mentions the fact of
Louis XIV. making a present to Charles II. of England of two hundred
pièces of excellent wine&mdash;Champagne, Burgundy, and Hermitage; and three
years later is fain himself to exclaim, &lsquo;Vive le pain de Gonesse, vive
le bon vin de Paris, de Bourgogne, de Champagne!&rsquo; whilst Tavernier the
traveller did his best to spread the fame of the Champagne wine by
presenting specimens to all the sovereigns whom he had the honour of
saluting during his journeyings abroad.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>It was about the eighth decade of this century, when the renown of the
Grand Monarque was yet at its apogee, and when for many years the soil
of the province had not been profaned by the foot of an invader, that
the still wine of the Champagne attained its final point of perfection.
The Roi Soleil himself, we are assured by St. Simon, never drank any
other wine in his life till about 1692, when his physician, the austere
Fagon, condemned his debilitated stomach to well-watered Burgundy, so
old that it was almost tasteless, and the king consoled himself with
laughing at the wry faces pulled by foreign nobles who sought and
obtained the honour of tasting his especial tipple.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> An anonymous
Mémoire<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> written early in the ensuing century (1718) states that,
although their red wine had long before been made with greater care
and cleanliness than any other wine in the kingdom, the Champenois
had only studied to produce a <em>gray</em>, and indeed almost white, wine,
within the preceding fifty years. This would place about 1670 the first
introduction of the new colourless wine, obtained by gathering grapes
of the black variety with the utmost care at early dawn, and ceasing
the vintage at nine or ten in the morning, unless the day were cloudy.
Despite these precautions a rosy tinge&mdash;compared to that lent by a
dying sunset to the waters of a clear stream&mdash;was often communicated
to the wine, and led to the term &lsquo;partridge&rsquo;s eye&rsquo; being applied to
it. St. Evremond, the epicurean Frenchman&mdash;who emigrated to the gay
court of Charles II. at Whitehall to escape the gloomy cell designed
for him in the Bastille&mdash;and the mentor of the Count de Grammont,
writing from London about 1674, to his brother &lsquo;profès dans l&rsquo;ordre des
coteaux,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the Count d&rsquo;Olonne, then undergoing on his part a species
of exile at Orleans for having suffered his tongue to wag a little too
freely at court, says: &lsquo;Do not spare any expense to get Champagne wines,
even if you are at two hundred leagues from Paris. Those of Burgundy
have lost their credit amongst men of taste, and barely retain a remnant
of their former reputation amongst dealers. There is no province which
furnishes excellent wines for all seasons but Champagne. It supplies us
with the wines of Ay, Avenay, and Hautvillers, up to the spring; Taissy,
Sillery, Verzenai, for the rest of the year.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> &lsquo;The wines of the
Champagne,&rsquo; elsewhere remarks this renowned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gourmet</i>, &lsquo;are the best.
Do not keep those of Ay too long; do not begin those of Reims too soon.
Cold weather preserves the spirit of the River wines, hot removes the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goût de terroir</i> from those of the Mountain.&rsquo; Writing also in 1701, he
alludes to the care with which the Sillery wines were made forty years
before.</p>

<p>Such a distinction of seasons would imply that wine, instead of being
kept, was drunk within a few months of its manufacture; though this,
except in the case of wine made as &lsquo;tocane,&rsquo; which could not be kept,
would appear to be a matter rather of taste than necessity. This custom
of drinking it before fermentation was achieved, and also the natural
tendency of the wine of this particular region to effervesce&mdash;a tendency
since taken such signal advantage of by the manufacturers of sparkling
Champagne&mdash;are treated of in a work of the period,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> the author of
which, after noting the excellence of certain growths of Burgundy, goes
on to say that, &lsquo;If the vintage in the Champagne is a successful one, it
is thither that the shrewd and dainty hasten. There is not,&rsquo; continues
he, &lsquo;in the world a drink more noble and more delicious; and it is now
become so highly fashionable that, with the exception of those growths
drawn from that fertile and agreeable district which we call in general
parlance that of Reims, and particularly from St. Thierry, Verzenay,
Ay, and different spots of the Mountain, all others are looked upon by
the dainty as little better than poor stuff and trash, which they will
not even hear spoken of.&rsquo; He extols the admirable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sève</i> of the Reims
wine, its delicious flavour, and its perfume, which with ludicrous
hyperbole he pronounces capable of bringing the dead to life. Burgundy
and Champagne, he says, are both good, but the first rank belongs to
the latter, &lsquo;when it has not that tartness which some debauchees esteem
so highly, when it clears itself promptly, and only works as much as
the natural strength of the wine allows; for it does not do to trust so
much to that kind of wine which is always in a fury, and boils without
intermission in its vessel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Such wine, he maintains, is quite done for by the time Easter is over,
and only retains of its former fire a crude tartness very unpleasant and
very indigestible, which is apt to affect the chest of those who drink
it. He recommends that Champagne should be drunk at least six months
after the end of the year, and that the grayest wines should always
be chosen as going down more smoothly and clogging the stomach less,
since, however good the red wine may be as regards body, from its longer
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvaison</i>, it is never so delicate, nor does it digest so promptly,
as the others. He concludes, therefore, that it is better to drink
old wine, or at any rate what then passed as old wine, as long as one
can, in order not to have to turn too soon to the new ones, &lsquo;which are
veritable head-splitters, and from their potency capable of deranging
the strongest constitutions.&rsquo; Above all, he urges abstinence from such
&lsquo;artificial mummeries&rsquo; as the use of ice, &lsquo;the most pernicious of all
inventions&rsquo; and the enemy of wine, though at that time, he admits, very
fashionable, especially amongst certain &lsquo;obstreperous voluptuaries,&rsquo;
&lsquo;who maintain that the wine of Reims is never more delicious than
when it is drunk with ice, and that this admirable beverage derives
especial charms from this fatal novelty.&rsquo; Ice, he holds, not only
dispels the spirit and diminishes the flavour, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sève</i>, and colour of
the wine, but is most pernicious and deadly to the drinker, causing
&lsquo;colics, shiverings, horrible convulsions, and sudden weakness, so that
frequently death has crowned the most magnificent debauches, and turned
a place of joy and mirth into a sepulchre.&rsquo; Wherefore let all drinkers
of Champagne <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frappé</i> beware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we have ample proof of the popularity of the wines of the
Champagne, a popularity erroneously said to be due in some measure
to the fact that both the Chancellor le Tellier, father of Louvois,
and Colbert, the energetic comptroller-general of the state finances,
and son of a wool-merchant of Reims, possessed large vineyards in the
province.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Lafontaine, who was born in the neighbourhood, declared
his preference for Reims above all cities, on account of the Sainte
Ampoule, its good wine, and the abundance of other charming objects;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
and Boileau, writing in 1674, depicts an ignorant churchman, whose
library consisted of a score of well-filled hogsheads, as being fully
aware of the particular vineyard at Reims over which the community he
belonged to held a mortgage.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> James II. of England was particularly
partial to the wine of the Champagne. When the quinquennial assembly
of the clergy was held in 1700, at the Château of St. Germain-en-Laye,
where he was residing, Charles Maurice le Tellier, brother to Louvois
and Archbishop of Reims, who presided, &lsquo;kept a grand table, and had some
Champagne wine that was highly praised. The King of England, who rarely
drank any other, heard of it, and sent to ask some of the archbishop,
who sent him six bottles. Some time afterwards the king, who found the
wine very good, sent to beg him to send some more. The archbishop, more
avaricious of his wine than of his money, answered curtly that his wine
was not mad, and therefore did not run about the streets, and did not
send him any.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Du Chesne, who, when Fagon became medical attendant
to Louis XIV., succeeded him as physician to the &lsquo;fils de France,&rsquo; and
who died at Versailles in 1707, aged ninety-one, in perfect health,
ascribed his longevity to his habit of eating a salad every night at
supper, and drinking only Champagne, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> which he recommended to
all.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The wine was nevertheless the indirect cause of the death of the poet
Santeuil, who, although a canon of St. Victor, was very much fonder
of Champagne and of sundry other good things than he ought to have
been. A wit and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivant</i>, he was a great favourite of the Duc de
Bourbon, son of the Prince de Condé, whom he accompanied in the summer
of 1697 to Dijon. &lsquo;One evening at supper the duke amused himself with
plying Santeuil with Champagne, and going on from joke to joke, he
thought it funny to empty his snuff-box into a goblet of wine, and make
Santeuil drink it, in order to see what would happen. He was pretty soon
enlightened. Vomiting and fever ensued, and within forty-eight hours the
unhappy wretch died in the torments of the damned, but filled with the
sentiments of great penitence, with which he received the sacraments and
edified the company, who, though little given to be edified, disapproved
of <em>such a cruel experiment</em>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Of course nothing was done, or even
said, to the duke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; said the president of a deputation bringing specimens of the
various productions of Reims to the Grand Monarque when he visited the
city in 1666, &lsquo;we offer you our wine, our pears, our gingerbread, our
biscuits, and our hearts;&rsquo; and Louis, who was a noted lover of the good
things of this life, answered, turning to his suite, &lsquo;There, gentlemen,
that is just the kind of speech I like.&rsquo; To this day Reims manufactures
by the myriad the crisp finger-shaped sponge-cakes called &lsquo;biscuits de
Reims,&rsquo; which the French delight to dip in their wine; juvenile France
still eagerly devours its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pain d&rsquo;épice</i>, and the city sends forth far
and wide the baked pears which have obtained so enviable a reputation.
But the production of such wine as that offered to the king has long
since almost ceased, while its fame has been eclipsed tenfold by wine
of a far more delicious kind, the origin and rise of which has now to
be recounted. This is the sparkling wine of Champagne, which has been
fitly compared to one of those younger sons of good family, who, after
a brilliant and rapid career, achieve a position far eclipsing that of
their elder brethren, whose fame becomes merged in theirs.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">A <span class="smaller">SYBARITE</span>
of our day has remarked that the life of the ancient Greeks
would have approached the perfection of earthly existence had they
only been acquainted with sparkling Champagne. As, however, amongst
the nations of antiquity the newly-made wine was sometimes allowed
to continue its fermentation in close vessels, it may be conceived
that when freshly drawn it occasionally possessed a certain degree of
briskness from the retained carbonic acid gas.

<p>The early vintagers of the Champagne can hardly have helped noting
the natural tendency of their wine to effervesce, the difficulty of
entirely overcoming which is exemplified in the precautions invariably
taken for the production of Sillery sec; indeed tradition claims for
certain growths of the Marne, from a period of remote antiquity, a
disposition to froth and sparkle.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Local writers profess to recognise
in the property ascribed by Henry of Andelys to the wine of Chalons,
of causing both the stomach and the heels to swell,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> a reference to
this peculiarity.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The learned Baccius, physician to Pope Sixtus V.,
writing at the close of the sixteenth century of the wines of France,
mentions those &lsquo;which bubble out of the glass, and which flatter the
smell as much as the taste,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> though he does not refer to any wine of
the Champagne by name. An anonymous author, some eighty years later,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
condemns the growing partiality for the &lsquo;great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i> which certain
debauchees esteem so highly&rsquo; in Champagne wines, and denounces &lsquo;that
kind of wine which is always in a fury, and which boils without ceasing
in its vessel.&rsquo; Still he seems to refer to wine in casks, which lost
these tumultuous properties after Easter. Necessity being the mother of
invention, the inhabitants of the province had in the sixteenth century
already devised and put in practice a method of allaying fermentation,
and obtaining a settled wine within four-and-twenty hours, by filling a
vessel with &lsquo;small chips of the wood called in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sayette</i>,&rsquo; and
pouring the wine over them.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>With all this, a conscientious writer candidly acknowledges that,
despite minute and painstaking researches, he cannot tell when what is
now known as sparkling Champagne first made its appearance. The most
ancient references to it of a positive character that he could discover
are contained in the poems of Grenan and Coffin, printed in 1711 and
1712; yet its invention certainly dates prior to that epoch,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and
earlier poets have also praised it. It seems most probable that the
tendency to effervescence already noted became even more marked in
the strong-bodied gray and &lsquo;partridge-eye&rsquo; wines, first made from red
grapes about 1670, than in the yellowish wine previously produced, like
that of Ay, from white grapes,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and recommended, from its deficiency
in body, to be drunk off within the year.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> These new wines, when
in a quasi-effervescent state prior to the month of March, offered a

some old <em>gourmets</em> might have complained, with St. Evremond, of the
taste introduced by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux delicats</i>.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> They must have been merely
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cremant</i> wines&mdash;for glass-bottle making was in its infancy, and corks

first and second years, but with age acquire the characteristics of a
full-bodied still wine. The difficulty of regulating their effervescence
in those pre-scientific days must have led to frequent and serious
disappointments. The hour, however, came, and with it the man.</p>

<p>In the year 1670, among the sunny vineyard slopes rising from the
poplar-fringed Marne, there stood in all its pride the famous royal
Abbey of St. Peter at Hautvillers. Its foundation, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
remote antiquity,
was hallowed by saintly legend. Tradition said that about the middle of
the seventh century St. Nivard, Bishop of Reims, and his godson, St.
Berchier, were seeking a suitable spot for the erection of a monastery
on the banks of the river. The way was long, the day was warm, and
the saints but mortal. Weary and faint, they sat down to rest at a
spot identified by tradition with a vineyard at Dizy, to-day belonging
to Messrs. Bollinger, but at that time forming part of the forest of
the Marne. St. Nivard fell asleep, with his head in St. Berchier&rsquo;s
lap, when the one in a dream, and the other with waking eyes, saw
a snow-white dove&mdash;the same, firm believers in miracles suggested,
which had brought down the holy oil for the anointment of Clovis
at his coronation at Reims&mdash;flutter through the wood, and finally
alight afar off on the stump of a tree. Such an omen could no more be
neglected by a seventh-century saint than a slate full of scribble
by a nineteenth-century spiritualist, and accordingly the site thus
miraculously indicated was forthwith decided upon. Plans for the edifice
were duly drawn out and approved of, and the abbey rose in stately
majesty, the high altar at which St. Berchier was solemnly invested with
the symbols of abbatial dignity being erected upon the precise spot
occupied by the tree on which the snow-white dove had alighted.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
As time rolled on and pious donations poured in, the abbey waxed in
importance, although it was sacked by the Normans when they ravaged the
Champagne, and was twice destroyed by fire&mdash;once in 1098, and again in
1440&mdash;when each time it rose ph&oelig;nix-like from its ashes.</p>

<p>In 1670 the abbey was, as we have said, in all its glory. True, it had
been somewhat damaged a century previously by the Huguenots, who had
fired the church, driven out the monks, sacked the wine-cellars, burnt
the archives, and committed sundry other depredations inherent to civil
and religious warfare; but the liberal contributions of the faithful,
including Queen Marie de Medicis, had helped to efface all traces of
their visit. The abbey boasted many precious relics rescued from the
Reformers&rsquo; fury, the most important being the body of St. Helena, the
mother of Constantine the Great, which had been in its possession
since 844, and attracted numerous pilgrims. The hierarchical status
of the abbey was high; for no less than nine archbishops had passed
forth through its stately portal to the see of Reims, and twenty-two
abbots, including the venerable Peter of Cluny, to various distinguished
monasteries. Its territorial possessions were extensive; for its abbot
was lord of Hautvillers, Cumières, Cormoyeux, Bomery, and Dizy la
Rivière, and had all manner of rights of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourmage</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">huchage</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vinage</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pressoir banal</i>, and the like,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> to the benefit of the
monks and the misfortune of their numerous dependents. Its revenues were
ample, and no small portion was derived from the tithes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of fair and
fertile vinelands extending for miles around, and from the vineyards
which the monks themselves cultivated in the immediate neighbourhood of
the abbey.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that for a lengthy period&mdash;not only in France,
but in other countries&mdash;the choicest wines were those produced in
vineyards belonging to the Church, and that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinum theologium</i> was
justly held superior to all others. The rich chapters and monasteries
were more studious of the quality than of the quantity of their
vintages; their land was tilled with particular care, and the learning,
of which in the Middle Ages they were almost the sole depositaries,
combined with opportunities of observation enjoyed by the members of
these fraternities by reason of their retired pursuits, made them
acquainted at a very early period with the best methods of controlling
the fermentation of the grape and ameliorating its produce.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> To
the monks of Bèze we owe Chambertin, the favourite wine of the first
Napoleon; to the Cistercians of Citaulx the perfection of that Clos
Vougeot which passing regiments saluted <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tambour battant</i>; and the
Benedictines of Hautvillers were equally regardful of the renown of
their wines and vineyards. In 1636 they cultivated one hundred arpents
themselves,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> their possessions including the vineyards now known as
Les Quartiers and Les Prières at Hautvillers, and Les Barillets, Sainte
Hélène, and Cotes-à-bras at Cumières, the last named of which still
retains a high reputation.</p>

<div class="figright">

   <img class="top2" src="images/fig052.jpg"
      alt="Monks Saying Grace" />
</div>

<p>Over these vineyards there presided in 1670 a worthy Benedictine named
Dom Perignon, who was destined to gain for the abbey a more world-wide
fame than the devoutest of its monks or the proudest of its abbots.
His position was an onerous one, for the reputation of the wine was
considerable, and it was necessary to maintain it. Henry of Andelys had
sung its praises as early as the thirteenth century; and St. Evremond,
though absent from France for nearly half a score years, wrote of it
in terms proving that he had preserved a lively recollection of its
merits. Dom Perignon was born at Sainte Ménehould in 1638, and had
been elected to the post of procureur of the abbey about 1668, on
account of the purity of his taste and the soundness of his head. He
proved himself fully equal to the momentous task, devotion to which
does not seem to have shortened his days, since he died at the ripe
old age of seventy-seven. It was Dom Perignon&rsquo;s duty to superintend
the abbey vineyards, supervise the making of the wine, and see after
the tithes, paid either in wine or grapes<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> by the neighbouring
cultivators to their seignorial lord the abbot. The wine which thus
came into his charge was naturally of various qualities; and having
noted that one kind of soil imparted fragrance and another generosity,
while the produce of others was deficient in both of these attributes,
Dom Perignon, in the spirit of a true Benedictine, hit upon the happy
idea of &lsquo;marrying,&rsquo; or blending, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
produce of different vineyards
together,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> a practice which is to-day very generally followed by the
manufacturers of Champagne. Such was the perfection of Dom Perignon&rsquo;s
skill and the delicacy of his palate, that in his later years, when
blind from age, he used to have the grapes of the different districts
brought to him, and, recognising each kind by its flavour, would say,
&lsquo;You must marry the wine of this vineyard with that of such another.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

      alt="Dom Perignon Checking the Wine" />
</div>

<p>But the crowning glory of the Benedictine&rsquo;s long and useful life
remains to be told. He succeeded in obtaining for the first time in
the Champagne a perfectly white wine from black grapes, that hitherto
made having been gray, or of a pale-straw colour.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Moreover, by some
happy accident, or by a series of experimental researches&mdash;for the
exact facts of the discovery are lost for ever&mdash;he hit upon a method
of regulating the tendency of the wines of this region to effervesce,
and by paying regard to the epoch of bottling, finally succeeded in
producing a perfectly sparkling wine, that burst forth from the bottle
and overflowed the glass, and was twice as dainty to the palate, and
twice as exhilarating in its effects, as the ordinary wine of the
Champagne. A correlative result of his investigations was the present
system of corking bottles, a wisp of tow dipped in oil being the sole
stopper in use prior to his time.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> To him, too, we owe not only
sparkling Champagne itself, but the proper kind of glass to drink it
out of. The tall, thin, tapering <em>flute</em> was adopted, if not invented,
by him, in order, as he said, that he might watch the dance of the
sparkling atoms.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The exact date of Dom Perignon&rsquo;s discovery of
sparkling wine seems to be wrapped in much the same obscurity as are the
various attendant circumstances. It was certainly prior to the close of
the seventeenth century; as the author of an anonymous treatise, printed
at Reims in 1718, remarked that for more than twenty years past the
taste of the French had inclined towards sparkling wines, which they had
&lsquo;frantically adored,&rsquo; though during the last three years they had grown
a little out of conceit with them.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> This would place it at 1697, at
the latest.</p>

<p>To Dom Perignon the abbey&rsquo;s well-stocked cellar was a far cheerfuller
place than the cell. Nothing delighted him more than</p>

<p>Ever busy among his vats and presses, barrels and bottles, Perignon
found out a method of clearing wine, so as to preserve it perfectly
limpid and free from all deposit, without being obliged, like all who
sought to rival him in its production, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépoter</i> the bottles&mdash;that
is, to decant their contents into fresh ones.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> This secret, which
helped to maintain the high reputation of the wine of Hautvillers when
the manufacture of sparkling Champagne had extended throughout the
district, he guarded even better than he was able to guard the apple of
his eye. At his death, in 1715, he revealed it only to his successor,
Frère Philippe, who, after holding sway over vat and vineyard for fifty
years, died in 1765, imparting it with his latest breath to Frère André
Lemaire. Revoked perforce from his functions by the French Revolution,
he in turn, before his death about 1795, communicated it to Dom
Grossart, who exults over the fact that whilst the greatest Champagne
merchants were obliged to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépoter</i>, the monks of Hautvillers had never
done so.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Dom Grossart, who had counted the Moëts amongst his
customers, died in his turn without making any sign, so that the secret
of Perignon perished with him. Prior to that event, however, the present
system of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeage</i> was discovered, and eventually <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépotage</i> was no
longer practised.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The material result of Dom Perignon&rsquo;s labours was such that one of the
presses of the abbey bore this inscription: &lsquo;M. de Fourville, abbot of
this abbey, had me constructed in the year 1694, and that same year
sold his wine at a thousand livres the queue.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Their moral effect
was so complete that his name became identified with the wine of the
abbey. People asked for the wine of Perignon, till they forgot that
he was a man and not a vineyard,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and within a year of his death
his name figures amongst a list of the wine-producing slopes of the
Champagne.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> His reputation has outlasted the walls within which he
carried on his labours, and his merits are thus recorded, in conventual
Latin of the period, on a black-marble slab still to be seen within the
altar-steps of the abbey-church of Hautvillers.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The anonymous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire</i> of 1718 gives, with an amount of preliminary
flourish which would imply a doubt as to the accuracy of the statement
made, the secret mode said to have been employed by Dom Perignon to
improve his wine, and to have been confided by him a few days before
his death to &lsquo;a person worthy enough of belief,&rsquo; by whom it was in turn
communicated to the writer. According to this, a pound of sugar-candy
was dissolved in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chopine</i> of wine, to which was then added five or
six stoned peaches, four sous&rsquo; worth of powdered cinnamon, a grated
nutmeg, and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi septier</i> of burnt brandy; and the whole, after
being well mixed, was strained through fine linen into a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce</i> of
wine immediately after fermentation had ceased, with the result of
imparting to it a dainty and delicate flavour. Dom Grossart, however,
in his letter to M. Dherbès, distinctly declares that &lsquo;we never did put
sugar into our wine.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">collature</i>, in which peaches play a
part, was probably made use of by some wine-growers; and the peach-like
flavour extolled by St. Evremond in the wine of Ay may have been due
to it, or to the practice then and long afterwards followed of putting
peach-leaves in the hot water with which the barrels were washed out,
under the idea that this improved the flavour of the wine.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Opinions were widely divided as to the cause of the effervescence in the
wines of Hautvillers, for the connection between sugar and fermentation
was then undreamt of, although Van Helmont had recognised the existence
of carbonic acid gas in fermenting wine as early as 1624. Some thought
it due to the addition of drugs, and sought to obtain it by putting not
only alum and spirits of wine, but positive nastinesses, into their
wine.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Others ascribed it to the greenness of the wine, because most
of that which effervesced was extremely raw; and others again believed
that it was influenced by the age of the moon at the epoch of bottling.
Experience undoubtedly showed that wine bottled between the vintage
and the month of May was certain to effervesce, and that no time was
more favourable for this operation than the end of the second quarter
of the moon of March. Nevertheless, as the wines, especially those of
the Mountain of Reims, were not usually matured at this epoch, it was
recommended, in order to secure a ripe and exquisite sparkling wine,
to defer the bottling until the ascent of the sap in the vine between
the tenth and fourteenth day of the moon of August; whereas, to insure
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non mousseux</i> wine, the bottling ought to take place in October or
November.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

the present term, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin de Champagne</i>, was confined as yet to the still
or quasi-still growths&mdash;quickly spread. Never, indeed, was a discovery
more opportune. At the moment of its introduction the glory of France
was on the wane; Colbert, Louvois, and Luxembourg were dead; the Treaty
of Ryswick had been signed; famine and deficit reared their threatening
heads, and lo, Providence offered this new consolation for all outward
and inward ills. With the King it could only find scant favour. The
once brilliant Louis was now a bigoted and almost isolated invalid. His
debilitated stomach, ruined by long indulgence, could scarcely even
support the old Burgundy&mdash;so old that it was almost tasteless&mdash;which
Fagon had prescribed as his sole beverage some years before;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and
the popping of sparkling Champagne corks would have scandalised the
quiet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> repasts which he was wont to partake of with the
pious Madame de Maintenon.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>But the men who were to be the future <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roués</i> of the Regency were in the
flower of youthful manhood in 1698, and the recommendation of Comus had
with them more weight than the warnings of Æsculapius. At the joyous
suppers of Anet, where the Duc de Vendôme laid aside the laurels of Mars
to wreathe his brows with the ivy of Bacchus; at the Temple, where his
brother, the Grand Prior, nightly revived the most scandalous features
of the orgies of ancient Rome; at the Palais Royal, where the future
Regent was inaugurating that long series of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits soupers</i> which were
ultimately to cost the lives of himself and his favourite daughter;
and at Chantilly, where the Prince de Conti sought successfully to
reproduce a younger and brighter Versailles, the pear-shaped flasks,
&lsquo;ten inches high, including the four or five of the neck,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> stamped
with the arms of the noble hosts, and secured with Spanish wax,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
were an indispensable adjunct to the festivities of the table. A story
is told of the Marquis de Sillery, who had turned his sword into a
pruning-knife, and applied himself to the cultivation of the paternal
vineyards, having first introduced the sparkling wine bearing his name
at one of the Anet suppers, when, at a given signal, a dozen of blooming
young damsels, scantily draped in the guise of Bacchanals, entered the
room, bearing apparently baskets of flowers in their hands, but which,
on being placed before the guests, proved to be flower-enwreathed bottles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of the new sparkling wine.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> If ever a beverage was intended
for the pleasures of society, it was certainly this one, which it was
said Nature had made especially for the French,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> who found in its
discovery a compensation for the victories of Marlborough.</p>

<p>Chaulieu, the poetic abbé, and the favourite of both the Vendômes,
hailed this new product of his native province in rapturous strophes. In
an invitation to supper addressed to his friend, the Marquis de la Fare,
in 1701, he describes how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In a letter to St. Evremond, he mentions sundry wonderful things that
should happen &lsquo;if the Muses were as fond of the wine of Champagne as the
poet who writes this to you;&rsquo; and, in one to the Marquis de Dangeau,
jestingly remarks that</p>

<p>Replying to an invitation to Sonning&rsquo;s house at Neuilly on July 20,
1707, he says that when he comes it will be wonderful to see how the
Champagne will be drained from the tall glasses known as <em>flutes</em>.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
That the Champagne he extols was a sparkling wine is established in a
poetical epistle to Madame D., in answer to her complaint that the wine
he had sent her did not froth as when they supped together, and in this
he also speaks of its newness.</p>

<p>His brother-rhymster, Jean Baptiste Rousseau, who must not be
confounded with the philosophic Jean Jacques, invited Chaulieu to join
him at Neuilly, in mingling the water of Hippocrene with the wine of
Hautvillers,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and announced to the Champagne-loving Marquis d&rsquo;Ussé,

<p>Such general attention did the subject attract that Frederick William
II. of Prussia actually proposed to the Academy of Arts and Sciences
at Berlin the question, &lsquo;Why does Champagne foam?&rsquo; for solution. The
Academicians, with unexpected sharpness, petitioned the King for a
supply of the beverage in question on which to experiment. But the
parsimonious monarch was equal to the occasion, and a solitary dozen
of the wine was all he would consent to furnish them with. His ally,
Augustus the Strong of Saxony, was the hero of a ludicrous adventure
connected with sparkling Champagne. At a banquet given to him at
Dresden, a page, who had surreptitiously appropriated a bottle of
this costly beverage, and hidden it in the breast of his coat, had to
approach the King.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
The heat and motion combined had imparted briskness
to the wine, out popped the cork, and the embroidered garments and
flowing periwig of Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s &lsquo;Man of Sin&rsquo; were drenched with the
foaming liquid. The page fell on his knees and roared for mercy, and
the King, as soon as he recovered from his bursts of laughter, freely
forgave him his offence.</p>

<p>The success of Dom Perignon&rsquo;s wine caused a revolution in the
wine-production of the province, and gave rise to numerous imitations,
despite the outcry raised against sparkling wine by many <em>gourmets</em>, and
even by the wine-merchants themselves, who complained that they had to
pander to what they regarded as a depraved taste. The elder Bertin du
Rocheret, father of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lieutenant criminel</i> and a notable dealer in
wine, was much opposed to it.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Marshal de Montesquiou d&rsquo;Artagnan,
the gallant assailant of Denain, had ordered some wine of him, and he

the best wine of Pierry at 400 francs the queue, not to be drawn off as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>&mdash;that would be too great a pity. Also a poinçon to be drawn
off as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i> at 250 francs the queue; or, if you will only go as
far as 180 francs, it will froth just as well, or better. Also a poinçon
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tocane</i> of Ay to be drunk this winter&mdash;that is to say, it should
be drunk by Shrovetide&mdash;at 300 francs the queue: this wine is very
fine.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>On the 27th December 1712 the Marshal writes: &lsquo;With regard to my wine
being made <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>, many prefer that it should be so; and I should
not be vexed, provided it does not in any way depreciate its quality.&rsquo;
On the 18th October of the following year the stern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudator temporis
acti</i> describes how the bottling has been carried out, &lsquo;in order that
your wines might be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>, without which I should not have done it,
and perhaps you would have found it better, but it would not have had
the merit of being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>, which in my opinion is the merit of a
poor wine, and only proper to beer, chocolate, and whipped cream. Good
Champagne should be clear and fine, should sparkle in the glass, and
should flatter the palate, as it never does when it is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>, but
has a smack of fermentation; hence it is only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i> because it is
working.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The converted Marshal replies on October 25th: &lsquo;I was in the wrong
to ask you to bottle my wine so that it might be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>; it is a
fashion that prevails everywhere, especially amongst young people.
For my own part, I care very little about it; but I wish the wine to
be clear and fine, and to have a strong Champagne bouquet.&rsquo; In the
following December Bertin, in answer to the Marshal&rsquo;s request for three
quartaux of wine, says: &lsquo;Will you kindly let me know at what date you
propose to drink this wine? If it is to be drunk as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>, I shall
not agree with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The allusion to the time of year at which the wine was to be drunk
throws a light upon a practice of the day, confirmed by other passages
in this correspondence. Much of the wine made was drunk as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
bourru</i> fined, but not racked off, at the beginning of the year, or
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tocane</i>, which was apt to go off if kept beyond Shrovetide. This
speedy consumption and the careful choice made of the grapes intended
for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> militated against the formation in the bottles of
that deposit, which, up to the commencement of the present century, when
the system of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeage</i> was introduced, could only be remedied by
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépotage</i>,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> though, as we have seen, the Abbey of Hautvillers had a
secret method, carefully guarded, of checking its formation.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>It is singular that the presence of a natural <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liqueur</i>&mdash;the consequence
of a complete but not excessive ripeness of the grape, and at present
considered one of the highest qualities of the wine&mdash;was, at the
commencement of the eighteenth century, regarded as a disease. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire</i> of 1718 states that when the wine has any liqueur, however
good it may otherwise be, it is not esteemed, and recommends the owner
to get rid of this &lsquo;bad quality&rsquo; forthwith by putting a pint of new
milk warm from the cow into each <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce</i>, stirring it well, letting
it rest three days, and then racking the wine off. At this epoch the
wine of the Champagne seems to have been preferred perfectly dry.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
In June 1716 the Marshal d&rsquo;Artagnan reproached Bertin du Rocheret for
sending him Hautvillers wine of the preceding vintage which had turned
out <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreuse</i>. However, in August he felt forced to write that it had
become excellent, and similar experiences seem to have soon removed all
prejudices against this liqueur character. Bertin, in 1725, speaks of
it as one of the qualities of wine, and charges for it in proportion;
and six years later remarks that the English are as mad for liqueur and
colour in their wines as the French.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>One cause of this falling off in the popularity of the sparkling wine
arose from the great battle which raged for many years respecting the
relative merits of Champagne and Burgundy. It was waged in the schools,
and not in the field; for the combatants were neither dashing soldiers,
brilliant courtiers, nor even gay young students, but potent, grave,
and reverend physicians&mdash;the wigged, capped, and gowned pedants of the
Diaphorus type whom Molière so piteously pilloried. The only blood shed
was that of the grape, excepting when some enthusiastic Sangrado was
impelled by a too conscientious practical examination into the qualities
of the vintage he championed to a more than ordinary reckless use of
the lancet. The contending armies couched pens instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> lances,
and marshalled arguments in array in place of squadrons. They hurled
pamphlets and theses at each others&rsquo; heads in lieu of bombshells, and
kept up withal a running fire of versification, so that the rumble of
hexameters replaced that of artillery.</p>

</div>

<p>National pride, and perhaps a smack of envy at the growing popularity
of the still red wines of the Champagne, had, as far back as 1652, led
a hot-headed young Burgundian, one Daniel Arbinet, to select as the
subject of a thesis, maintained by him before the schools of Paris,
the proposition that the wine of Beaune was more delicious and more
wholesome than any other wine,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> the remaining vintages of the
universe being pretty roughly handled in the thesis in question. The
Champenois contented themselves for the time being with cultivating
their vineyards and improving their wines, till in 1677, when these
latter had acquired yet more renown, M. de Révélois of Reims boldly
rushed into print with the assertion that the wine of Reims was the
most wholesome of all.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Though the first to write in its favour,
he was not the first doctor of eminence who had expressed an opinion
favourable to the wine of Champagne. Péna, a leading Parisian physician
of the seventeenth century, was once consulted by a stranger. &lsquo;Where do
you come from?&rsquo; he inquired. &lsquo;I am a native of Saumur.&rsquo; &lsquo;A native of
Saumur. What bread do you eat?&rsquo; &lsquo;Bread from the Belle Cave.&rsquo; &lsquo;A native

<p>Burgundy remained silent in turn for nearly twenty years, when, lo, in
1696&mdash;probably just about the time when the popping of Dom Perignon&rsquo;s
corks began to make some noise in the world&mdash;a yet more opinionated
young champion of the Côte d&rsquo;Or, Mathieu Fournier, a medical student,
hard pressed for the subject of his inaugural thesis, and in the firm

<p>propounded the theory that the wines of Reims irritated the nerves, and
caused a predisposition to catarrh, gout, and other disorders, owing
to which Fagon, the King&rsquo;s physician, had forbidden them to his royal

<p>Shocked at these scandalous assertions, the entire Faculty of Medicine
at the Reims University rose in arms in defence of their native vintage.
Its periwigged professors put their learned heads together to discuss
the all-important question, &lsquo;Is the wine of Reims more agreeable and
more wholesome than the wine of Burgundy?&rsquo; and in 1700 Giles Culotteau
embodied their combined opinions in a pamphlet published under that
title.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> After extolling the liquid purity, the excellent brightness,
the divine flavour, the paradisiacal perfume, and the great durability
of the wines of Ay, Pierry, Verzy, Sillery, Hautvillers, &amp;c., as
superior to those of any growth of Burgundy, he instanced the case of a
local Old Parr named Pierre Pieton, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vigneron</i> of Hautvillers, who had
married at the age of 110, and reached that of 118 without infirmity,
as a convincing proof of the material advantages reaped from their
consumption.</p>

<p>Salins, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doyen</i> of the Faculty of Medicine of Beaune, was intrusted
with the task of replying, and in 1704 bitterly assailed Culotteau&rsquo;s
thesis in a &lsquo;Defence of the Wine of Burgundy against the Wine of
Champagne,&rsquo; which ran to five editions in four years. M. le Pescheur,
a doctor of Reims, vigorously attacked each of these editions in
succession, maintaining amongst other things that the wine of Reims
owed its renown to the many virtues discovered in it by the great lords
who had accompanied Louis XIV. to his coronation; and that if the King,
on the advice of his doctors, had renounced its use, his courtiers had
certainly not. He also asserted that England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Germany, and the North
of Europe consumed far more Champagne than they did Burgundy, and that
it would be transported without risk to the end of the world, Tavernier
having taken it to Persia, and another traveller to Siam and Surinam.</p>

<p>The partisanship quickly spread throughout the country, and the
respective admirers of Burgundy and Champagne pitilessly pelted each
other in prose and verse; for the two camps had their troubadours, who,
like those of old, excited the courage and ardour of the combatants. The
first to sound the warlike trumpet was Benigné Grenan, professor at the
college of Harcourt, who, with the rich vintage of his native province
bubbling at fever-heat through his veins, sought in 1711 to crush
Champagne by means of Latin sapphics, a sample of which has been thus
translated:</p>

learned Dr. Charles Coffin, a native of Buzancy, near Reims, who in
the quiet retirement of the Picardian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alma Mater</i> had evidently not
forgotten to keep up his acquaintance with the vintage of his native
province. The Latin poem he produced in reply, under the title of

sepulchral name, as may be seen by the following somewhat freely
translated extracts from it. After invoking the aid of a bottle of the
enlivening liquor whose praises he is about to sing, he exclaims:</p>

<p>The jovial old rector with the sepulchral appellation then proceeds,
according to the most approved method of warfare, to carry the campaign
into the enemy&rsquo;s territory. He admits the nutritive and strengthening
properties of Burgundy, but demands what it possesses beyond these,
which are shared in common with it by many other vintages. He then
prophesies, with the return of peace,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the advent of the English to
buy the wine of Reims; and concludes by wishing that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> who dispute
the merits of Champagne may find nothing to drink but the sour cider of
Normandy or the acrid vintage of Ivri. The citizens of Reims, thoroughly
alive to the importance of the controversy, were enchanted with this
production; they did not, however, crown the poet with laurel, but more
wisely and appropriately despatched to him four dozen of their best red
and gray wines, by the aid of which he continued to tipple and to sing.</p>

<p>Grenan, resuming the offensive in turn, at once addressed an epistle
in Latin verse, in favour of Burgundy against Champagne, to Fagon, the
King&rsquo;s physician.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Complaining that the latter wine lays claim
unjustly to the first rank, he allows it certain qualities&mdash;brilliancy,
purity, limpidity, a subtle savour that touches the most blunted
palate, and an aroma so delicious that it is impossible to resist its
attractions. But he objects to its pretensions.</p>

<p>He goes on to accuse the Champenois poet of being unduly inspired by
this wine, the effects of which he finds apparent in his inflated style
and his attempts to place Champagne in the first rank, and make all
other vintages its subjects; and he reiterates his allegations that,
unlike Burgundy, it affects both the head and the stomach, and is bound
to produce gout and gravel in its systematic imbibers. He concludes by
begging Fagon to pronounce in his favour, as having proved the virtues
of Burgundy on the King himself, whose strength had been sustained by
it. The retort was sharp and to the point, taking the form of a twofold
epigram from an anonymous hand:</p>

<p>Nor was the poet of the funereal cognomen backward in stepping into the
field; for he published a metrical decree, supposed to be issued by the
faculty of the island of Cos in the fourth year of the ninety-first
Olympiad,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> in which, though a verdict is nominally given in favour
of Burgundy, Grenan&rsquo;s pleas on behalf of this wine are treated with
withering sarcasm.</p>

<p>But whilst these enthusiastic partisans thus belaboured one another,
there were not wanting impartial spirits who could recognise that there
were merits on both sides. Bellechaume, in an ode

<p>And the learned Canon Maucroix of Reims exhibited a similar conciliatory
spirit in the ingenious parallel which he drew between the two greatest
orators of antiquity and the wines of the Marne and the Côte d&rsquo;Or.
&lsquo;In the wine of Burgundy,&rsquo; he observes, &lsquo;there is more strength and
vigour; it does not play with its man so much, it overthrows him more
suddenly,&mdash;that is Demosthenes. The wine of Champagne is subtler and
more delicate; it amuses more and for a longer time, but in the end it
does not produce less effect,&mdash;that is Cicero.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>But the doctors continued to disagree, and new generations of them
still went on wrangling over the vexed questions of supremacy and
salubrity. In 1739 Jean François carried the war into the enemy&rsquo;s camp
by maintaining at Paris that Burgundy caused gout; and a little later
Robert Linguet declared the wine of Reims to be as healthy as it was
agreeable. In 1777 Xavier, Regent of the Faculty of Medicine at the
Reims University, affirmed that not only did the once vilified <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
mousseux</i> share with the other wines of the Champagne the absence of
the tartarous particles which in many red wines are productive of
gout and gravel, but that the gas it contained caused it to act as a
dissolvent upon stone in the human body, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
also invaluable, from
its antiseptic qualities, in treating putrid fevers.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Further,
the appropriately named Champagne Dufresnay established, to his own
satisfaction and that of his colleagues, that the wine was superior to
any other growth, native or foreign.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> At length, in 1778, when the
bones of the original disputants were dust, and their lancets rust, on
the occasion of a thesis being defended before the Faculty of Medicine
of Paris, a verdict was formally pronounced by this body in favour of
the wine of the Champagne.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">W<span class="smaller">HILST</span> doctors went on shaking their periwigged heads, and debating
whether sparkling Champagne did or did not injure the nerves and produce
gout, the timid might hearken to their counsels, but there were plenty
of spirits bold enough to let the corks pop gaily, regardless of all
consequences. The wine continued in high favour with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viveurs</i> of
the capital, and especially with the brilliant band of titled scoundrels
who formed the Court of Philippe le Débonnaire. &lsquo;When my son gets
drunk,&rsquo; wrote, on the 13th August 1716, the Princess Charlotte Elizabeth
of Bavaria, the Regent&rsquo;s mother, &lsquo;it is not with strong drinks or spirituous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
liquors, but pure wine of Champagne;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and as the pupil

consumed a fair amount of the fluid in question in the course of his
career. Even his boon companion, the Duke de Richelieu, is forced to
admit that there was a great deal more drunkenness about him than was
becoming in a Regent of France; and that, as he could not support wine
so well as his guests, he often rose from the table drunk, or with his
wits wool-gathering. &lsquo;Two bottles of Champagne,&rsquo; remarks the duke in his
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chronique</cite>, &lsquo;had this effect upon him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Desirous, seemingly, that such enjoyments should not be confined to
himself alone, he abolished in 1719 sundry dues on wine in general,
whilst his famous, or rather infamous, suppers conduced to the vogue of
that sparkling Champagne which was an indispensable accompaniment of
those <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décolleté</i> repasts. It unloosed the tongues and waistcoats of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roués</i> of the Palais Royal, the Nocés, Broglios, Birons, Brancas,
and Canillacs; it lent an additional sparkle to the bright eyes of
Mesdames de Parabère and de Sabran, and inspired the scathing remark
from the lips of one of those fair frail ones, that &lsquo;God, after having
made man, took up a little mud, and used it to form the souls of princes
and lackeys.&rsquo; It played its part, too, at the memorable repast at which
the Regent and his favourite daughter so scandalised their hostess, the
Duchess of Burgundy, and at the fatal orgie shared by the same pair on
the terrace of Meudon.</p>

<p>The example set in such high quarters could not fail to be followed.
Champagne fired the sallies of the wits and versifiers whom the Duchess
of Maine gathered around her at Sceaux, and stimulated the madness which
seized upon the whole of Paris at the bidding of the financier Law. It
frothed, too, in the goblets which Bertin du Rocheret had the honour of
filling with his own hand for Peter the Great, on the passage of the
Northern Colossus through Reims in June 1717; and its consumption was
increased by a decree of 1728, which especially provided that people
proceeding to their country seats might take with them for their own use
a certain quantity of this wine free of duty.</p>

<p>A curious purpose to which the wine was applied appeared from a wager
laid by the Count de Saillans&mdash;one of the most famous horsemen of his
day, and already distinguished by similar feats&mdash;to the effect that he
would ride a single horse from the gate of Versailles to the Hôtel des
Invalides within an hour. His wife, fearing the dangerous descent from
Sèvres towards Paris, prevailed on the King to prohibit him from riding
in person; but a valet, whose neck was of course of no moment, was
allowed to act as his deputy in essaying the feat. The horse selected
was carefully fed for some days beforehand on biscuits and Champagne.
Crowds assembled to witness the attempt, which was made on May 9, 1725,
and resulted in the valet&rsquo;s coming in two and a half minutes behind
time. Whether this was due to the badness of the roads, as was alleged,
or to the singular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> adopted for the animal selected, remains a
moot question.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Champagne won equal favour in the eyes of Louis XV., as in those
of the curious compound of embodied vices who had watched over the
welfare of the kingdom during his minority, though it is true that at a
comparatively early age&mdash;in the year 1731&mdash;he had, on representations that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
over-production of wine was lowering its value, prohibited the
planting of fresh vineyards without his permission under a penalty of
3000 francs, and had renewed this prohibition the year following.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The royal repasts at La Muette, Marly, and Choissy were, however,
enlivened with wine from the Champagne; for we find Bertin du Rocheret
in 1738 despatching thirty pieces of the still wine to M. de Castagnet
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits cabinets du Roi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and the eldest of the fair

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
&lsquo;Queen of Choissy&rsquo; and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maîtresse en titre</i>, in 1740 reforming the

orgies of the royal household.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Her conduct in this respect seems,
however, not to have been dictated by motives of virtue, but rather
by the conviction that the wine was too precious to be consumed by
inferiors. We are assured that the countess loved wine, and above all
that of Champagne, and that she could hold her own against the stoutest
toper. &lsquo;She has been reproached with having imparted this taste to the
King, but it is probable that his Majesty was naturally inclined that
way.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>When, in 1741, the &lsquo;Well-Beloved&rsquo; passed through Reims, Dom Chatelain,
after rejoicing over the year&rsquo;s vintage having been a very fine one,
adds that it was drunk to a considerable extent and with the greatest
joy in the world during the ten days that the King remained in the city.
&lsquo;It was no longer a question,&rsquo; he exclaims exultingly, &lsquo;of sending
for Burgundy or Laon wine.&rsquo; Three years later, when traversing the
Champagne, on his way to Metz, he again halted at Reims; and after
hearing mass, &lsquo;retired to the Archevêché, where the Corps de la Ville
presented his Majesty with the wines of the town, which he ordered to be
taken to his apartments.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Wine was also presented to the Prince de
Soubise, Governor of the Champagne; the Duke de Villeroy, M. d&rsquo;Argenson,
and the Count de Joyeuse; whilst, for the benefit of the populace,
four fountains of the same fluid flowed at the corners of the Place
de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In like manner, at the inauguration of that
&lsquo;brazen lie,&rsquo; the statue of this same Louis XV., in 1767, wine flowed in
rivers from the different fountains of the city.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The satyr-like sovereign of France was by no means the only monarch
of his time who appreciated sparkling Champagne. Frederick the Great
has praised its consoling powers in the doggerel which Voltaire was
engaged to turn into poetry; and George II. of England at St. James&rsquo;s,
and Stanislas Leczinski of Poland at Nancy, both quaffed of the same
vintage of Ay despatched in 1754 from the cellars of Bertin du Rocheret.
Marshal Saxe, during his sojourn in 1745 at Brussels, where he held
a quasi-royal court, of which Mademoiselle de Navarre was the bright
particular star, drew an ample supply of Champagne from the cellars
of that lady&rsquo;s father, Claude Hevin de Navarre of Avenay, who had
established himself as a wine merchant in the Belgian capital.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
Despite, too, the continued outcry of some connoisseurs,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> became the universal source of inspiration for the

unmoved by the excellent still Champagne with which he and the Duke de
Richelieu had been regaled at Epernay by Bertin du Rocheret in May 1735,
persisted in singing the praises of the effervescing wine of Ay, in the
sparkling foam of which he professed to find the type of the French
nation:<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The Commander Descartes seems not to have been afraid to extol the
charms of the sparkling wine to the younger Bertin du Rocheret, as stern
a decrier of its merits as his father had previously been. In a letter
dated December 1735, asking for &lsquo;one or two dozen bottles of sparkling
white wine, neither <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i> nor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreux</i>, &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;some</p>

<p>Amongst other versifiers of this epoch enamoured with the merits of the
wine may be cited Charles Lebatteux, professor of rhetoric at Reims
University, who in 1739 composed an ode, &lsquo;In Civitatem Remensam,&rsquo;
containing the following invocation to Bacchus:</p>

<p>Bertin du Rocheret, who by no means shared his friend Voltaire&rsquo;s
admiration for the sparkling vintage of Ay, sang the praises of the
still wine of the Champagne after the following fashion in 1741:</p>

<p>Marmontel, the author of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bélisaire</i> and editor of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercure de
France</cite>, found inspiration in his youthful days in the sparkling wine
of Champagne. He describes, in somewhat fatuous style, the results of
an invitation he received from Mademoiselle de Navarre to pass some
months with her in 1746 at Avenay, where her father owned several
vineyards, and where, she added, &lsquo;It will be very unfortunate if with
me and some excellent vin de Champagne you do not produce good verses.&rsquo;
He tells how, in stormy weather, she insisted, on account of her fear
of lightning, on dining in the cellars, where, &lsquo;in the midst of fifty
thousand bottles of Champagne, it was difficult not to lose one&rsquo;s
head;&rsquo; and how he was accustomed to read to her the verses thus jointly
inspired when seated together on a wooded hillock, rising amidst the
vineyards of Avenay.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing in some degree recalls the circumstances under which
Gluck, whose fame began to be established about this epoch, was
accustomed to seek his musical inspirations. The celebrated composer of
<em>Orpheus</em> and <em>Iphegenia in Aulis</em> was wont, when desirous of a visit
from the &lsquo;divine afflatus,&rsquo; to seat himself in the midst of a flowery
meadow with a couple of bottles of Champagne by his side. By the time
these were emptied, the air he was in search of was discovered and
written down.</p>

<p>The lively and good-humoured Abbé de l&rsquo;Attaignant, whose occupations as
a canon of Reims Cathedral seem to have allowed him an infinite quantity
of spare time to devote to versifying, addressed some rather indifferent
rhymes to Madame de Blagny on the cork of a bottle of Champagne
exploding in her hand;<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and in some lines to Madame de Boulogne, on
her pouring out Champagne for him at table, he maintains that the nectar
poured out by Ganymede to Jupiter at his repasts must yield to this
vintage.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>That boon convivialist Panard&mdash;who flourished at the same epoch, and
was one of the chief songsters of the original Caveau, and a man of
whom it was said that, &lsquo;when set running, the tide of song flowed on
till the cask was empty&rsquo;&mdash;has not neglected sparkling Champagne in his
Bacchanalian compositions. The &lsquo;La Fontaine of Vaudeville,&rsquo; as Marmontel
dubbed him, does not hesitate to admit that he preferred the popping of
Champagne corks to the martial strains of drum and trumpet.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The
wine, moreover, furnishes him with frequent illustrations for his code
of careless philosophy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Doctor for vintner vials fills</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Elsewhere Panard gives expression to the Bacchanalian sentiment, which
he seems to have made his rule of life, in the following terms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s quit this vain world, with its pleasures that cloy,</div>

      <div class="verse">Of Champagne and Beaune;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Our pleasure will there be without the alarms</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Of any joy queller;</div>
      <div class="verse">For the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> that often mounts up to the throne</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Will never descend to the cellar.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a><br /></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The poet appears to have rivalled one of the characters in his piece,
<em>Les Festes Sincères</em> (represented on the 5th October 1744 on the
occasion of the King&rsquo;s convalescence), who, after describing how wine
was freely proffered to all comers, said that he had contented himself
with thirty glasses, &lsquo;half Burgundy and half Champagne.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>In a piece of verse entitled &lsquo;La Charme du Vaudeville à Table,&rsquo; Panard
sketches in glowing colours the inspiriting effect of sparkling
Champagne upon such a joyous company of periwigged beaux and patched and
powdered beauties as we may imagine to be assembled at the hospitable
board of some rich financier of the epoch.</p>

<p>Despite the success achieved by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i>, merchants, owing
to the excessive breakage of the bottles&mdash;of the cause of which and
of the means of stopping it they were equally ignorant&mdash;often saw
their hopes of fortune fly away with the splintered fragments of the
shattered glass.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The following passages from the <span class="smaller">MS.</span> notes
of the founder of one of the first houses of Reims, written in 1770,
would imply some knowledge of the fact that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreux</i> wine was
likely to lead to a destructive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casse</i>, and also that the importance
of the trade in sparkling Champagne was far greater during the first
half of the eighteenth century than is usually supposed.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The
<span class="smaller">MS.</span> in question says: &lsquo;In 1746 I bottled 6000 bottles of a
very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreux</i> wine; I had only 120 bottles of it left. In 1747 there
was less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liqueur</i>; the breakage amounted to one-third of the whole. In
1748 it was more vinous and less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreux</i>; the breakage was only a
sixth. In 1759 it was more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rond</i>, and the breakage was only a tenth.
In 1766 the wine of Jacquelet was very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rond</i>; the breakage was only a
twentieth.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The writer then proceeds to recommend, as a means of preventing
breakage, that the wine should not be bottled till the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liqueur</i> had
almost disappeared, and that, if necessary, fermentation should be
checked by well beating the wine. But as at that epoch there was really
no means of effectually testing this disappearance, and as the beating
theory was an utterly fallacious one, the followers of his precepts
remained with the sad alternative of producing in too many instances
either <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousses folles</i> and their inevitable accompaniment of disastrous
breakage, or wine so mature as to be incapable of continuing its
fermentation in bottle, and producing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousse</i> at all.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>It is therefore evident that much of the sparkling wine drunk at the
commencement of the last century was what we should call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crémant</i>, or,
as it was then styled, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sablant</i>,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> as otherwise the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> breakage would
have been something frightful. Bertin du Rocheret plainly indicates
after 1730 a difference between the fiercely frothing kinds, to which
the term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saute bouchon</i> or pop-cork was applied, and wine that was
merely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The price of the former is the highest, ranging
up to 3 livres 6 sols, whilst that of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mousseux</i> does not exceed
50 sols, the difference in the two being no doubt based to a certain
extent on the loss by breakage.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Hence, too, a partiality for weak sour growths for making <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
mousseux</i>, as, although science could give no reason, experience
showed that with these the breakage would be less than with those of a
saccharine nature.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Thus Bertin writes in 1744 that the vineyards of
Avize, planted for the most part in 1715, and almost entirely with white
grapes, only produced a thin wine, with a tartness that caused it to be
one of the least esteemed in the district; but that &lsquo;since the mania for
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saute bouchon</i>, that abominable beverage, which has become yet more
loathsome from an insupportable acidity,&rsquo; the Avize wines had increased
in value eightfold.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> To this acidity the Abbé Bignon refers in a
poem of 1741, in which, protesting against the partiality for violently
effervescing wines, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Your palate is a cripple</div>
      <div class="verse">Worn out by fiery tipple,</div>
      <div class="verse">Or else it would prefer juice</div>
      <div class="verse">Of grapes to fizzing verjuice.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This serves to explain the preference so long accorded by <em>gourmets</em> to
the finer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non mousseux</i> wines, full of aroma and flavour, and often
sugary and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreux</i>, but looked upon by the general public up to the
close of the eighteenth century as inferior to those which were sharp,
strong, and even sourish, but which effervesced well.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Lingering
relics of prejudice against sparkling wine existed as late as 1782, when
that conscientious observer, Legrand d&rsquo;Aussy, remarked that since it
had been known that sparkling wines were green wines bottled in spring,
when the universal revolution of Nature causes them to enter into
fermentation, they had not been so much esteemed, the <em>gourmets</em> of that
day preferring those which did not sparkle.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>It was not till the close of the eighteenth century that any attempt
was openly made to improve sparkling Champagne by the addition of
sugar.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Science then came forward to prove that such an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> addition
was not contrary to the nature of wine, and that fermentation converted
the saccharine particles of the must into alcohol, and increased the
vinosity.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Several growers began to profit by this discovery of
Chaptal, though, as a rule, those who followed his recommendations in
secret were loudest in asserting that Providence alone had rendered
their wine better than that of their neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> M. Nicolas Perrier
of Epernay, an ex-monk of Prémontré, pointed out, at the beginning of
the present century, that up to that period sugar was only regarded as
a means of rendering the wine more pleasant to drink, and had always
been added after fermentation, and as late as possible. This practice
was favoured by the tyrannical routine reigning among the peasants of
not tasting the wine till December or January, when in 1800 a decisive
experience confirmed the value of the new discoveries. Numerous demands
for wine during the vintage led to anticipations of a brisk and
speedy sale, and sugar was thereupon added at the time of the first
fermentation, merely with the view, however, of bringing the wine more
forward for the buyer to taste. The result went beyond the expectations
entertained; and at Ay wines of the second class, commonly called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vins
de vignerons</i>, rose to a price previously unheard of.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The present system of clearing the wine in bottles was not practised
formerly. People were then not so particular about its perfect
limpidity; besides which the wine consumed at the beginning of the
year<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> had not time to deposit, and that bottled as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>, owing
to its being originally made from carefully-selected grapes, formed very
little sediment in the flask.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The method of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">collage</i> employed at
the Abbey of Hautvillers is said to have preserved the wines from this
evil. Whether this method transpired, or other people discovered it, is
unknown; but certainly Bertin du Rocheret transmitted it, or something
very similar, in July 1752 to his correspondent in London, who bottled
Champagne wines regularly every year.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The necessity of ridding the wine of the deposit which deprived it of
its limpidity was, however, recognised later on. At first no other
method suggested itself, excepting to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépoter</i> it&mdash;that is, to decant
it into another bottle; a plan fraught, in the case of sparkling wines,
with several disadvantages. At the commencement of the present century,
however, the system of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeage</i> was substituted.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> As at first
practised, each bottle was held neck downwards, and either shaken
or tapped at the bottom to detach the sediment, the operation being
constantly repeated until the deposit had settled in the neck, when it
was driven out by the force of the explosion which followed upon the
removal of the cork. Somewhat later the plan now followed of placing
the bottles in sloping racks and turning them every day was adopted, to
the great saving of time and labour. Its discovery has been popularly
attributed to Madame Clicquot; but the fact is the suggestion emanated
from a person in her employ named Müller. The idea is said to have
simultaneously occurred to a workman in Marizet&rsquo;s house of the name of
Thommassin.</p>

<p>Although the advent of such a delectable beverage as sparkling Champagne
proved of much benefit to the world in general, and the wine-merchants
of Reims and Epernay in particular, those most immediately concerned
in its production had little or no reason to rejoice over its renown.
The hapless peasants, from whose patches of vineyard it was to a great
extent derived, were the last to profit by its popularity. Bidet,
writing in 1759, foreshadows the misery which marked the last thirty
years of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien régime</i>.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Speaking of the important trade
in wine carried on by the city of Reims, he urges that this would in
reality be benefited by the old decrees, prohibiting the planting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> of
new vineyards in the Champagne, being enforced to the letter. Extensive
plantations of vines in land suitable for the growth of corn had doubled
and even tripled the value of arable land, and caused a rise in the
price of wheat. Manure, so necessary to bring these new plantations into
bearing, and wood, owing to the demand for vine-stakes, barrel-staves,
&amp;c., had risen to thrice their former value. Recent epidemics had
cost the lives of a large number of vine-dressers, and public
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corvées</i> occupied the survivors a great part of the year, and hence
a considerable increase in the cost of cultivation, landowners having
to pay high wages to labourers from a distance. &lsquo;Putting together all
these excessive charges, with the crushing dues levied in addition upon
vine-land as well as upon the sale and transport of wine, the result
will infallibly be that the more profitable the wine-trade formerly was
to Reims and to the vineyards of the environs, the more it will languish
in the end, till it becomes a burden to all the vineyard owners.&rsquo;
Happily these gloomy forebodings have since been completely falsified.</p>

<p>But the wine had by no means acquitted all its dues. The merchant buying
it had to pay another 75 francs to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ferme</i> before despatching it to
the consumer. When he did despatch it, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ferme</i> strictly prescribed
the route it was to take, any deviation from this being punished by
confiscation; and it had to pay at almost every step. Transport by water
was excessively onerous from constantly recurring tolls, and by land
whole days were lost in undergoing examinations and verifications and

enable a wine-merchant of Reims to live in good style.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>On arriving at the town where it was to be drunk, the wine was subject

affected the grower; for if the retail consumer, inhibited by high

is scarcely to be wondered at that under such a system of excessive

no kind of luxury and enjoyment. They built themselves princely hotels,
rivalled the nobility and even the Court in the splendour of their

purchase, and loved pleasure

for its own sake, and women for their

Champagne had their bureaux, known as the Hôtel des Fermes, at Reims,
and, after the town-hall, this was the handsomest civil edifice in the
city. Erected in 1756 from designs by Legendre, it occupies to-day the
principal side of the Place Royale. On the pediment of the façade is a
bas-relief of Mercury, the god of commerce, in company with Penelope and
the youthful Pan, surrounding whom are children engaged with the vintage
and with bales of wool, typical of the staple trades of the capital of

<p>The revolutionary epoch presents a wide gap in the written history
of sparkling Champagne which no one seems to have taken the trouble
of filling, though this hiatus can be to some extent bridged over by
a glance at the caricatures of the period. It is evident from these
that Champagne continued to be the fashionable wine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>.
We can comprehend it was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</i> to &lsquo;fouetter le Champagne&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
at the epicurean repasts held at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits maisons</i> of the rich
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermiers généraux</i>, and that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">talons rouges</i> of the Court of
Louis Seize were not averse to the payment of 3 livres 10 sols for
a bottle of this delightful beverage<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> when regaling some fair
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émule</i> of Sophie Arnould or Mademoiselle Guimard in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coulisses</i>.
One evening Mademoiselle Laguerre appeared on the stage as Iphigenia
unmistakably intoxicated. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; interjected the lively Sophie, &lsquo;this
is not Iphigenia in Tauris, but Iphigenia in Champagne.&rsquo; A proof of
the aristocratic status of the wine is furnished by a print entitled
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L&rsquo;Accord Fraternel</i>, published at the very outset of the revolutionary
movement, when it was fondly hoped that the Three Orders of the States
General would unite in bringing about a harmonious solution to the
evils by which France was sorely beset. In this the burly well-fed
representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> of the clergy holds out a bumper of Burgundy; the
peasant&mdash;not one of the lean scraggy labourers, with neither shirt
nor sabots,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> prowling about half naked and hunger-stricken in
quest of roots and nettle-tops, but a regular stage peasant in white
stockings and pumps&mdash;grips a tumbler well filled with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin du pays</i>;
while the nobleman, elaborately arrayed in full military costume, with
sword, cockade, and tie-wig all complete, delicately poises between
his finger and thumb a tall <em>flute</em> charged with sparkling Champagne.
Moreover, we can plainly trace the exhilarating influence of the wine
upon the &lsquo;feather-headed young ensigns&rsquo; at the memorable banquet given
to the officers of the Régiment de Flandre by the Gardes du Corps at
Versailles, on the 2d Oct. 1789.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

war, his physical and bibacious attributes are very happily hit off.
His body is a barrel; his arms, pitchers; his thighs, rundlets; and
his legs inverted Champagne flasks; whilst in his left hand he holds a
foam-crowned <em>flute</em>, and in his right another of those flasks, two of
which he was credited with emptying at each repast.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that the origin of many of the most famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crûs</i> of France
was due to monkish labours, and that at Reims, as elsewhere, a large
proportion of the ecclesiastical revenue was derived, either directly
or indirectly, from the vineyards of the district. This was happily
hit off in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Nouveau Pressoir du Clergé</cite>, or <cite>New Wine-Press for the
Clergy</cite>, published in 1789. A man of the people and a representative

a full-faced abbé is rapidly disgorging a shower of gold. A yet more

<p>The chief personal traits of Louis Seize, as depicted in numerous
contemporary memoirs, seem to have been a passion for making locks and
a gross and inordinate appetite. High feeding usually implies deep
drinking, and one may suppose that a wine so highly esteemed at Court
as Champagne was not neglected by the royal gourmand. Still there seems
to have been nothing in the unfortunate monarch&rsquo;s career to justify
the cruel caricature wherein he is shown with the ears and hoofs of a
swine wallowing in a wine-vat, with bottles, flasks, pitchers, cups,
goblets, glasses, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flûtes</i> of every variety scattered around him;

is shown seated at table&mdash;surrounded by stringed flasks of Champagne,
with the customary tall glasses&mdash;engaged in devouring a plump capon. His
Majesty is evidently annoyed at being interrupted in the middle of his
repast, but it is difficult to divine who the intruder is intended for.
He can scarcely be one of the commissioners despatched by the National
Assembly to secure the king&rsquo;s return to Paris, as the German hussars
drawn up in the doorway are inconsistent with this supposition. The
female figure before the looking-glass is of course intended for Marie
Antoinette, whilst the ungainly young cub in the background is meant for

<p>As to the pamphleteers, who advocated the Rights of Man and aspersed
Marie Antoinette; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
poets, who addressed their countless airy trifles
to Phyllis and Chloe; the penniless disciples of Boucher and Greuze;
and the incipient demagogues, briefless advocates, unbeneficed abbés,
discontented bourgeois, whose eloquence was to shatter the throne of
the Bourbons, they were fain for the time being to content themselves
with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit bleu</i> of Argenteuil or Suresnes, consumed in company
with Manon or Margot, in one of the dingy smoky <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabarets</i> which the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i> was so soon in a great measure to replace. When, however, their
day did come, we may be sure they denied themselves no luxury, and
sparkling Champagne would certainly have graced Danton&rsquo;s luxurious
repasts, and may possibly have played its part at the last repast of
the condemned Girondins. In &rsquo;93, we find Champagne of 1779&mdash;the still
wine, of course&mdash;announced for sale at Lemoine&rsquo;s shop in the Palais
Royal; while a delectable compound, styled <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crême de fleur d&rsquo;orange

<p>Although details respecting the progress of the Champagne wine-trade
at home and abroad at the outset of the present century are somewhat
scanty, we readily gather that the great popularity of the sparkling
wine throughout Europe dates from an event which, at the time of its
occurrence, the short-sighted Champenois looked upon as most disastrous.
This was the Allied invasion of 1814&ndash;15. Consumption, so far as the
foreign market was concerned, had been grievously interrupted by the
great upset in all commercial matters consequent upon the wars of the
Revolution and the Empire. It appears that the white wines of Champagne
were sent to Paris, Normandy, Italy, and, &lsquo;when circumstances permitted
of it,&rsquo; to England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Spain, Portugal,
and &lsquo;beyond the seas.&rsquo; But the trade had suffered greatly during the
wars with Austria and Russia in 1806 and 1807; and in the following
years the consumption of white wine had fallen considerably, and a large
number of wine-merchants had found themselves unable to meet their
engagements.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>The wine which Napoleon I. preferred is said to have been Chambertin;
still, his intimacy with the Moëts of Epernay could scarcely fail to
have led to a supply of the best sparkling Champagne from the cellars
he had deigned to visit in person. His satraps, who travelled with the
retinue of sovereign princes, included the wine in their equipment
wherever they went, and the popping of its mimic artillery echoed in
their tents the thunder of their victorious cannon. But comparatively
few foreign guests met at their tables; and as their foes had on their
side few victories to celebrate in a similar style, the knowledge of
sparkling Champagne outside France was confined to the comparatively
small number of persons of wealth and position able to pay an
extravagant price for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the fatal year, 1814, arrived, and the Allies swarmed across
the frontier after the &lsquo;nations&rsquo; fight&rsquo; at Leipzig. The Champagne
lying directly on the way to Paris saw some hard fighting and pitiless
plundering. The Prussians of Baron von Tromberg got most consumedly
drunk at Epernay. The Cossacks ravaged Rilly, Taissy, and the other
villages of the Mountain; and not being able to carry off all the wine
they found at Sillery, &lsquo;added to their atrocities,&rsquo; in the words of an
anonymous local chronicler,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> by staving in the barrels and flooding
the cellars. The Russians, under the renegade St. Priest, seized on
Reims, whetted their thirst with salt herrings till the retail price of
these dainties rose from 5 liards a pair to 3 sous apiece, and then set
to work to quench it with Champagne to such an extent that when Napoleon
suddenly swooped down upon the city like his own emblematic eagle, a
large number of them, especially among the officers, were neither in a
condition to fight nor fly.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The immense body of foreign troops who remained quartered in the east
of France after the downfall of the Empire continued to pay unabated
devotion to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dive bouteille</i>. Tradition has especially distinguished
the Russians, and relates how the Cossacks used to pour Champagne into
buckets, and share it with their horses. But the walking sand-beds of
North Germany, the swag-bellied warriors of Baden and Bavaria, and the
stanch topers of Saxony and Swabia must of a surety have distinguished
themselves. The votaries of Gambrinus, the beer king, strove whether
they could empty as many bottles of Champagne at a sitting as they could
flagons filled with the amber-hued beverage of their native province;
while the inhabitants of those districts where the grape ripens sought
to institute exhaustive comparisons between the vintages they gathered
at home and the growths of the favoured region in which they now found
themselves.</p>

<p>The Berliner was fain to acknowledge the superiority of the foam
engendered by Champagne over that crowning his favourite <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">weissbier</i>,
his own beloved <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kuhle blonde</i>, and the beer-topers of Munich and
Dresden to give the preference to the exhilaration produced by quaffing
the wine of Reims and Epernay over that due to the consumption of
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bockbier</i>. The Nassauer and the Rhinelander had to admit certain
intrinsic merits in the vintages produced on the slopes of the Marne,
and found to be lacking in those grown on the banks of the Rhine, the
Ahr, the Main, and the Moselle. The Austrian recognised the superiority
of the wines of the Mountain over those of Voslau or the Luttenberg;
and the Magyar had to allow that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crûs</i> of the River possessed a
special charm which Nature had denied to his imperial Tokay. Even the red-coated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
officers who followed &lsquo;Milord Vilainton&rsquo; to the great review
at Mont Aimé, near Epernay, proved faithless to that palladium of the
British mess-table, their beloved &lsquo;black strop.&rsquo; Claret might in their
eyes be only fit for boys and Frenchmen, and Port the sole drink for
men; but they were forced to hail Champagne as being, as old Baudius had
already phrased it, &lsquo;a wine for gods.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The officers of the Allied armies quartered in Paris after the Hundred
Days supplemented the charms of the Palais Royal&mdash;then in the very
apogee of its vogue as the true centre of Parisian life, with its cafés,
restaurants, theatres, gambling-houses, and Galeries de Bois&mdash;with an
abundance of sparkling Champagne. Royalty itself set the example by
indicating a marked preference for the wine, Louis Dixhuit, according
to a statement made by Wellington to Rogers, drinking nothing else
at dinner. To celebrate the victories of Leipsic and Waterloo or a
successful assault on the bank at Frascati&rsquo;s, to console for the loss
of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grosse mise</i> at No. 113 or of a comrade transfixed beneath a lamp
in the Rue Montpensier by a Bonapartist sword-blade, to win the smiles
of some fickle Aspasia of the Palais Royal Camp des Tartares or to blot
out the recollection of her infidelity, to wash down one of the Homeric
repasts in which the English prototypes of the &lsquo;Fudge Family Abroad&rsquo;
indulged, the wine was indispensable; until, as a modern writer has
put it, &lsquo;Waterloo was avenged at last by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gros bataillons</i> of the
bankers at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roulette</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trente et quarante</i>, and by the sale to the
invaders of many thousand bottles of rubbishing Champagne at twelve
francs the flask.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The rancorous enmity prevailing between the
officers of Bonapartist proclivities placed on half-pay and the returned
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émigrés</i> who had accepted commissions from Louis XVIII., resulted,
as is well known, in numerous hostile meetings. Captain Gronow has
dwelt upon the bellicose exploits of a gigantic Irish officer in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gardes du corps</i>, named Warren, who, when &lsquo;excited by Champagne and
brandy,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> was prepared to defy an army; and he tells us that at
Tortoni&rsquo;s there was a room set apart for such quarrelsome gentlemen,
where, after these meetings, they indulged in riotous Champagne
breakfasts.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> At home, the British Government were being twitted on
their parsimony in limiting the supply of Champagne for the table of the
exiled Emperor at St. Helena to a single bottle per diem, a circumstance
which led Sir Walter Scott to protest against the conduct of Lord
Bathurst and Sir Hudson Lowe in denying the captive &lsquo;even the solace of
intoxication.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As is not unfrequently the case, out of evil came good. The assembled
nations had drunk of a charmed fountain, and it had excited a thirst
which could not be quenched. The Russians had become acquainted with
Champagne, which Talleyrand had styled &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le vin civilisateur par
excellence</i>,&rsquo; and to love this wine was with them a very decided step
towards a liberal education. Millions of bottles, specially fortified to
the pitch of strength and sweetness suited for a hyperborean climate,
were annually despatched to the great northern empire from the house of
Clicquot; and later on the travellers of rival firms, eager to secure
a portion of this patronage, traversed the dominions of the autocrat
throughout their length and breadth, and poured their wines in wanton
profusion down the throats of one and all of those from whom there
appeared a prospect of securing custom.</p>

<p>From this influx of sparkling wine into the frozen empire of the Czar
the acceptance of civilisation&mdash;of rather a superficial character, it is
true&mdash;may be said to date. Had Peter the Great only preferred Champagne
to corn-brandy, the country would have been Europeanised long ago. As it
is, the wine has to-day become a recognised necessity in higher class
Russian society, and scandal even asserts that whenever it is given at
a dinner-party, the host is careful to throw the windows open, in order
that the popping of the corks may announce the fact to his neighbours.
Abroad the Russians are more reserved in their manners; and though
ranking amongst the best customers of the Parisian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">restaurateurs</i> for
high-class wines, it is only now and then that some excited Calmuck is
to be seen flooding the glasses of his companions with Champagne in
a public dining-room. The Russians, it should be noted, have sought,
and not unsuccessfully, to produce sparkling wines of their own, more
especially in the country of the Don Cossacks and near the Axis.</p>

<p>Béranger might exclaim, with a poet&rsquo;s license, that he preferred a
Turkish invasion to seeing the wines of the Champagne profaned by the
descendants of the Alemanni;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> but the merchants of Reims and Epernay
were of a different opinion. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les militaires</i> have always affected
Champagne; and a military aristocracy like that of the Fatherland,
in the cruel days when peace forbade any more free quarters and
requisitions, became as large purchasers of the wine as their somewhat
scanty revenues allowed of. Their example was followed to a considerable
extent by the self-made members of that plutocratic class which modern
speculation has caused to spring into life in Germany. Advantage was
speedily taken of this taste by their own countrymen, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
aimed at
supplanting Champagne by sparkling wines grown on native slopes. Nay
more, the Germans, as a military nation, felt bound to carry the war
into the enemy&rsquo;s territory, and hence it is that many important houses
at Reims and Epernay are of German origin. Across the Rhine patriotism
has had to yield to popularity, and the stanchest native topers have
been forced to acknowledge, after due comparison in smoky <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">wein stuben</i>
and gloomy <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">keller</i>, that, though the sparkling wines of the Rhine
and the Moselle are in their own way most excellent, there is but one
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Champagner-wein</i>, with Reims for its Mecca and Epernay for its Medina.</p>

<p>Of England we shall elsewhere speak at length; but the speculative
trade of her colonies, with its sharp bargains, dead smashes, and large
profits could hardly be carried on without the wheels of the car of
Commerce and the tongues of her votaries being oiled with Champagne.
The Swiss have only proved the truth of the proverb that imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery by producing tolerable replicas of
Champagne at Neufchâtel, Vevay, and Sion. Northern, or, to speak by the
map, Scandinavian, Europe takes its fair share of the genuine article;
and although the economic Belgian is apt to accept sparkling Saumur and
Vouvray as a substitute, both he and his neighbour, the Dutchman, can
to the full appreciate the superiority of the produce of the Marne over
that of the Loire.</p>

<p>The Italian and the Spaniard may affect to outwardly despise a liquor
which they profess not to be able to recognise as wine at all; but the
former has to allow, <em>per Bacco</em>, that it excels in its particular
way his extolled Lacryma Christi, while the latter does not carry his
proverbial sobriety so far as to exclude the wine from repasts in the
upper circles of Peninsular society. Moreover, of recent years they have
both commenced making sparkling wines of their own. The Austrian also
produces sparkling wines from native vintages, notably at Voslau, Graz,
and Marburg; still this has not in any way lessened his admiration for,
or his consumption of, Champagne. The Greek is ready enough to &lsquo;dash
down yon cup of Samian wine,&rsquo; provided there be a goblet of Champagne
close at hand to replace it with; and boyards and magnates of the
debateable ground of Eastern Europe not only imbibe the sparkling wines
of the Marne ostentatiously and approvingly, but several of them have
essayed the manufacture of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> on their own estates.</p>

<p>The East, the early home of the vine, and the first region to impart
civilisation, is perhaps the last to receive its reflux in the shape of
sparkling wine. But, the prohibition of the Prophet notwithstanding,
Champagne is to be purchased on the banks of the Golden Horn, and has
been imported extensively into Egypt in company with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">opéra-bouffe</i>,
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">figurantes</i>, stock-jobbing, and sundry other matters of
foreign extraction under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> of the late Khedive. The land
of Iran has beheld with wonderment its sovereign freely quaffing the
fizzing beverage of the Franks in place of the wine of Shiraz. The
East Indies consume Champagne in abundance; for it figures not only on
the proverbially hospitable tables of the merchants and officials of
Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, but at the symposia of most of the rajahs,
princes, nawabs, and other native rulers. The almond-eyed inhabitant
of &lsquo;far Cathay,&rsquo; reluctant to abandon that strange civilisation so
diametrically opposed in all its details to our own, continues to drink
his native vintages, warm and out of porcelain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
cups, and to regard
the sparkling drink of the Fanquis as a veritable &lsquo;devils&rsquo; elixir.&rsquo;
But his utterly differing neighbour, the Japanese, so eager to welcome
everything European, has gladly greeted the advent of Champagne, and
freely yielded to its fascination.</p>

<p>Turning to the undiscovered continent, we find sable sovereigns ruling
at the mouths of the unexplored rivers of Equatorial Africa fully
acquainted with Champagne, though disposed, from the native coarseness
of their taste, to rank it as inferior to rum; whilst the Arab, filled
with wonderment at the marvels of European civilisation which meet his
eye at Algiers, bears back with him to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douar</i>, wrapped up in the
folds of his burnous, a couple of bottles of the wondrous effervescing
drink of the Feringhees as a testimony, even as Othere brought the
walrus-tooth to Alfred. One enthusiastic Algerian colonist has gone so
far as to prophesy the advent of the day when the products of the native
vineyards shall eclipse Champagne.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Let us hope, however, in the
interest of Algerian digestions, that this day is as yet far distant.</p>

<p>With respect to the consumption of Champagne in the Western world,
the United States&rsquo; exceeds that of any European country, England and
France alone excepted, despite the competition of sparkling Catawba
and of a certain diabolical imitation, the raw material of which, it
is asserted, is furnished not by the grapes of the Carolinas, the
peaches of New Jersey, or the apples of Vermont, but by the oil-wells of
Pennsylvania&mdash;in fact, petroleum Champagne. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinet particulier</i>
seems to be an institution as firmly established in the leading
cities of the States as in Paris; and rumour says that drinking from
a Champagne-glass touched by a fair one&rsquo;s lips has replaced the New
England pastime of eating the same piece of maple-candy till mouths
meet. As regards the South American Republics, the popping of musketry
at each fresh <em>pronunciamento</em> is certain to be succeeded by that of
Champagne-corks in honour of the success of one or the other of the
contending parties.</p>

<p>In Europe Champagne has continued to be, from the days of Paulmier and
Venner downwards, the drink of kings, princes, and great lords as they
described it. Take a list of the potentates of the present century, and
the majority of them will be found to have evinced at some time or other
a partiality for the wine. Louis XVIII. drank nothing else at table. The
late ruler of Prussia, Frederick William IV., had such a penchant for
Champagne of a particular manufacture, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
obtained the cognomen
of King Clicquot. The predecessor of Pio Nono, Gregory XVI., rivalled
him in this appreciation, and, terrible to relate, so did the Commander
of the Faithful, Abdul Medjid. The latter might, however, have pleaded
the excuse put forward by Abd-el-Kader, that although the Prophet had
forbidden wine, yet Champagne came into the category of aerated waters,
concerning which he had said nothing, a remark justifying the title
given to this wit-inspiring beverage of being &lsquo;the father of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons
mots</i>.&rsquo; Prince Bismarck, in the stormy period of his youth, was in the
barbarous habit of imbibing Champagne mixed with porter; but at present
he judiciously alternates it with old Port. Marshal MacMahon and the
King of the Belgians are said to drink the pink variety of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
mousseux</i> by preference.</p>

<p>Naturally, in France as elsewhere, the sparkling vintage of the Marne
maintains its claims to be reckoned the wine of beauty and fashion,
and more especially in beauty&rsquo;s gayer hours. A glass of Champagne and
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biscuit de Reims</i> has been a refection which, though often verbally
declined, was in the end pretty sure to be accepted from the days of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">merveilleuses</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">incroyables</i>, through those of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lionnes</i>, down
to the present epoch of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocodettes de la haute gomme</i>. Neither at
ceremonial banquets nor at ordinary dinner-parties among our neighbours
does Champagne hold, however, so prominent a place as amongst ourselves,
owing to the great variety of other wines&mdash;all capable of appreciation
by trained palates&mdash;entering into the composition of these festive
repasts. In fact, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repas de noces</i> is the only occasion on which
Champagne flows in France with anything like the freedom to which we are
accustomed; and then it is that its exhilarating effect is marked, as
some portly old boy rises with twinkling eye to propose the health of
the bride, or of that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau
sexe</i> to which he feels bound to profess himself deeply devoted. At
such open-air gatherings as the races at Longchamps and Chantilly, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buffet</i> will be besieged by a succession of frail fair ones in the most
elaborate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toilettes de courses</i>, seeking to nerve themselves to witness
a coming struggle, or to console themselves for the defeat of the horse
backed by their favoured admirer. And, when writing of this wine, it
is altogether impossible to omit a reference to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
repasts <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en cabinet particulier</i>, of which it is the indispensable
adjunct. Its mollifying influence on the feminine heart on occasions
such as these has been happily hit off by Charles Monselet in his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Polichinelle au Restaurant</i>:</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">S<span class="smaller">O</span> great a favourite
as Champagne now is with all classes in England,
the earliest notice of it in connection with our history nevertheless
represents it in a somewhat inimical light. For, according to an
Italian writer of the fifteenth century, &lsquo;the strong and foaming wine
of Champagne was found so injurious that Henry V. was obliged, after
the battle of Agincourt, to forbid its use in his army, excepting
when tempered with water.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Although this may be the earliest
mention of the wine of the Champagne by name in association with our
own countrymen, opportunities had been previously afforded to them
of becoming acquainted with its assumed objectionable qualities. The
prelates who crossed &lsquo;the streak of silver sea&rsquo; with Thurstan of York
to attend the ecclesiastical councils held at &lsquo;little Rome,&rsquo; as Reims
was styled in the twelfth century, and the knights and nobles who
swelled the train of Henry II. when he did homage to Philip Augustus at
the latter&rsquo;s coronation, may be regarded as exceptionally fortunate,
or unfortunate, in this respect, since the bulk of the English
wine-drinkers of that day had to content themselves with the annual
shipments of Anjou and Poitevin wines from Nantes and La Rochelle.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
But the stout men-at-arms and death-dealing archers who followed the
third Edward to the gates of Reims in the days when</p>

<p>no doubt found consolation for some of the hardships they endured
during their wet and weary watches in the bitter winter of 1365 in the
familiarity they acquired with the vintages of the Mountain and the
Marne.</p>

</div>

<p>And, their sovereign&rsquo;s prohibition notwithstanding, there is every
reason to believe that the heroes of Agincourt drank pottle-deep of
the forbidden beverage. The grim Earl of Salisbury bore no love to the
burghers of Reims;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> but there is little likelihood that his aversion
extended to the wine of the province he ruled as governor, and the
garrisons of its various strongholds over which the red cross of St.
George triumphantly floated revelled on the best of &lsquo;the white wyne and
the rede.&rsquo; In the days of hot fighting and keen foraging which marked
the close of Bedford&rsquo;s regency, there is ample evidence to show that
our countrymen had acquired and retained a very decided taste for these
growths. When Charles VII. entered Reims in triumph, with Jeanne Darc by
his side and the chivalry of France around him, the retreating English
garrison bore forth with them on the opposite side of the city a string
of wains piled high with casks of wine, the pillage of the burghers&rsquo;
cellars.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Tradition tells, too, how the English, besieged in the town of Epernay,
had gathered there great store of wine, and how this suggested to
their captain a cunning stratagem. Having caused a number of wagons to
be laden with casks of wine, he despatched them with a feeble escort
through the gate furthest from the beleaguering forces, as though
destined to Chalons as a place of safety. The French commander marked
this, and as soon as the convoy was well clear of the walls, a body
of horse came spurring after it in hot haste. The wagon-train halted;
there was a brief attempt to turn the laden vehicles homewards, and
then, seeing the hopelessness of this, the escort galloped back into
the town, and down swooped the Frenchmen on their prize. The ride had
been sharp; the day was hot, and the road dusty. So a score of the
captured casks were quickly broached; and as the generous fluid flowed
freely down the throats of the captors, it soon began to produce an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
effect. Some of them, overcome by the heat and the wine, loosened their
armour, and stretched themselves at length on the ground; whilst others,
grouped around some fast emptying barrel, continued to quaff from their
helmets and other improvised drinking vessels confusion to the &lsquo;island
bull-dogs.&rsquo; When lo, the gate of the town flew open; an English trumpet
rang out its note of defiance; and, with lances levelled, the flower
of the garrison poured forth like a living avalanche upon the startled
Frenchmen. Before they could make ready to fight or fly, the foe was
upon them, and their blood was soon mingling on the dusty highway with
the pools of wine which had gushed forth from the abandoned casks.
Hardly one escaped the slaughter; but local tradition chuckles grimly
as it notes that in revenge thereof every man of the garrison was put
to the edge of the sword on the subsequent capture of the town by the
French.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the fruitless struggle against the growing power of
Charles the Victorious, we were fain to fall back, as of old, upon the
strong wines of south-western France, the vintages of Bergerac, Gaillac,
and Rabestens, shipped to us from the banks of the Garonne,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and the
luscious malmseys of the Archipelago, to which were subsequently added
the growths of southern Spain. The taste of the wine of the Champagne
must have been almost forgotten amongst us when the growing fame of the
vineyards of Ay attracted the notice of Bluff King Hal. Most likely he
and Francis I. swore eternal good fellowship at the Field of the Cloth
of Gold over a beaker of this regal liquor. Once alive to its merits,
the King, whose ambassadors, <em>pace</em> John Styles, seem to have had
standing orders to keep an equally sharp look out for wines or wives
likely to suit the royal fancy, neglected no opportunity of securing it
in perfection. Like his contemporaries, Charles V., Francis I., and Leo
X., he stationed a commissioner at Ay intrusted with the onerous duty of
selecting a certain number of casks of the best growths, and despatching
them, carefully sealed, to the cellars of Whitehall, Greenwich, and
Richmond. The example set by the monarch was, however, too costly a one
to be followed by his subjects, and the very name of Champagne probably
remained unknown to them for years to come. The poets and dramatists
of the Elizabethan era, who have left us so accurate a picture of the
manners of their day, and make such frequent allusions to the wines in
vogue, do not even mention Champagne; Gervase Markham preserves a like
silence in his <cite>Modern Housewife</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> while the passages in Surflet&rsquo;s
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Rustique</cite> extolling the wine of Ay are merely translations
from the original French edition.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> And though Venner speaks of
these wines as excelling all others, he is careful to attribute their
consumption to the King and the nobles of France.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The captive Queen of Scots, whose consumption of wine elicited dire
lament from one of her lordly jailers,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> may have missed at
Fotheringay the vintage she had tasted in early life when enjoying
the hospitality of her uncle, Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, at Reims;
but to the half-hearted pedant, her son, the name of Epernay recalled
no convivial associations&mdash;it was merely the title of a part of his
slaughtered mother&rsquo;s appanage. Spanish influence and Spanish wine ruled
supreme at his Court; and though Rhenish crowned the goblets of many of
the high-souled cavaliers who rallied round King Charles and Henrietta
Maria, the bulk of the English nation remained faithful, till the close
of the Commonwealth, to their old favourites of the south of Spain and
the fragrant produce of the Canaries.</p>

<p>All this was altered when &lsquo;the King enjoyed his own again;&rsquo; for
the Restoration made Champagne&mdash;that is, the still red wine of the
province&mdash;the most fashionable, if not the most popular, wine in
England. At the Court of Louis XIV. the future Merry Monarch and his
faithful followers had acquired a taste for the wines of France, and
they brought back this taste,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> together with sundry others of a far
more reprehensible character, with them to England. One of the first
and most acceptable gifts of Louis to his brother-sovereign on the
latter&rsquo;s recall was &lsquo;two hundred hogsheads of excellent wine&mdash;Champagne,
Burgundy, and Hermitage.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Returning home more French than the
French themselves, the late exiles ruminated on the flesh-pots of
Egypt, and sighed; and we can readily picture a gallant who had seen
hot service under Condé or Turenne exclaiming to his friend and
fellow-soldier:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;Ah, Courtine, must we be always idle? Must we never see our
glorious days again? When shall we be rolling in the lands of milk
and honey, encamped in large luxuriant vineyards, where the loaded
vines cluster about our tents, drink the rich juice just pressed
from the plump grape?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>And that friend replying:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;Ah, Beaugard, those days have been; but now we must resolve
to content ourselves at an humble rate. Methinks it is not
unpleasant to consider how I have seen thee in a large pavilion
drowning the heat of the day in Champagne wines&mdash;sparkling sweet
as those charming beauties whose dear remembrance every glass
recorded&mdash;with half a dozen honest fellows more.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Demand created supply, until, in 1667, a few years after the
Restoration, France furnished two-fifths of the amount of wine consumed
in the kingdom;<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and the taste of the royal sybarite for the
light-coloured wines of the Marne seems to be hinted at in Malagene&rsquo;s
exclamation:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;I have discovered a treasure of pale wine.... I assure you
&rsquo;tis the same the King drinks of.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>St. Evremond, who, though not precisely cast by Nature from &lsquo;the mould
of form,&rsquo; fulfilled for many years the duties of arbiter elegantiarum
at Charles&rsquo;s graceless Court, decidedly did his best to render the
Champagne <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flûte</i> &lsquo;the glass of fashion.&rsquo; Ever ready to speak in praise
of the wines of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Ay, Avenay, and Reims,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> the mentor of the Count
de Grammont strove by example as well as by precept to win converts to
his creed. In verse he declares that the beauties of the country fail
to console him for the absence of Champagne; regrets that the season
of the wines of the Marne is over, and that the yield of those of the
Mountain had failed; and shudders at the prospect of being obliged to
have recourse to the Loire, to Bordeaux, or to Cahors for the wine he
will have to drink.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The lively Frenchman found plenty of native writers to reëcho him.
Champagne sparkles in all the plays of the Restoration, and seems the
fitting inspiration of their matchless briskness of dialogue. The
Millamours and Bellairs, the Carelesses and Rangers, the Sir Joskin
Jolleys and Sir Fopling Flutters, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux</i> of the Mall and the
rakes of the Mulberry and New Spring Gardens, the gay frequenters of
the Folly on the Thames and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</i> of Pontack&rsquo;s Ordinary, whom
the contemporary dramatists transferred bodily to the stage of the
King&rsquo;s or the Duke&rsquo;s, are constantly tossing off bumpers of it. Their
lives would seem to have been one continuous round of love-making and
Champagne-drinking, to judge from the following &lsquo;catch,&rsquo; sung by four
merry gentlemen at a period when, according to Redding, ten thousand
tuns of French wine were annually pouring into England:</p>

vie with the dramatists in extolling its exhilarating effects&mdash;effects

Dorset, and Sedley in 1681, and who realised the fable of the pot of

consequent substitution in their place of those of Portugal. One can
imagine the consternation of the &lsquo;beaux&rsquo; and &lsquo;sparks&rsquo; at this fatal
decree, and the satisfaction of the few vintners whose cellars chanced
to be well stored with the forbidden vintages of France&mdash;with</p>

<p>But, Port wine and prohibitions notwithstanding, men of fashion of that
epoch were not entirely obliged to abandon their favourite potations,
since five thousand hogsheads of French wine were surreptitiously landed
on the south-west coast of England in a single year.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Fortunately,
too, for them, the Government came to the conclusion that it was for
the time being futile to fight against popular tastes, and in 1685 the
obnoxious prohibition was removed, with the result that, two years
later, the imports of French wine were registered as fifteen thousand
tuns&mdash;that is, sixty thousand hogsheads.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>On the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1689, the import of French
wines received a serious check, and as they vanished from the revenue
returns, so Champagne began to disappear from the social board and the
literature of the day. Strange to say, however, it was not only the
favourite wine of William III., but of his dethroned father-in-law,
James II. The red wines of the province of Champagne had always found
a ready sale in Flanders and the Low Countries,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and quickened the
minds of the stout seamen who fought against Blake and Rupert. The
variety produced from the Beaune grape at Vertus was the one patronised
by Macaulay&rsquo;s pet hero, the hook-nosed Dutchman,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> whilst the exile
of St. Germain seems to have been more catholic in his tastes.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Eagerly must the <em>gourmets</em> of the day, when, &lsquo;if we did not love the
French, we coveted their wines,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> have hailed the return of a peace
which permitted them not only to indulge in their old favourites, but to
welcome a new attraction in the shape of sparkling Champagne. The term
&lsquo;sparkling&rsquo; as applied to wine did not at the outset necessarily mean
effervescing, as in one of Farquhar&rsquo;s comedies we find Roebuck comparing
himself to &lsquo;a bumper of Claret, smiling and sparkling.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Towards the
close of the century, however, we meet with sure proof of the advent of
the delectable beverage with which the worthy cellarer of Hautvillers
was the first to endow droughty humanity. The contemporary dramatists
were ever on the alert to shoot Folly as she flew. The stage was really
the mirror of that time, and those who wrote for it seized on every
passing whim, fashion, or fancy of the day. The introduction of a new
wine was certainly not to be missed by them, and the recently discovered
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> of Dom Perignon is plainly referred to in Farquhar&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
aptly-named comedy, <cite>Love and a Bottle</cite>, produced in 1698, just after
the Peace of Ryswick had allowed the reopening of trade with France.</p>

<p>The second scene of act ii. represents the lodgings of Mockmode, the
country squire, who aims at being &lsquo;a beau,&rsquo; and who is discovered in
close confabulation with his landlady, the Widow Bullfinch:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;<i>Mock.</i> But what&rsquo;s most modish for beverage now? For I
suppose the fashion of that always alters with the clothes.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>W. Bull.</i> The tailors are the best judges of that; but
Champaign, I suppose.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Mock.</i> Is Champaign a tailor? Methinks it were a fitter name
for a wig-maker. I think they call my wig a campaign.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>W. Bull.</i> You&rsquo;re clear out, sir&mdash;clear out. Champaign is a
fine liquor, which all great beaux drink to make &rsquo;em witty.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Mock.</i> Witty! O, by the universe, I must be witty! I&rsquo;ll drink
nothing else; I never was witty in my life. Here, Club, bring us a
bottle of what d&rsquo;ye call it&mdash;the witty liquor.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Widow having retired, Club, Mockmode&rsquo;s servant, reënters with a
bottle and glasses.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;<i>Mock.</i> Is that the witty liquor? Come, fill the glasses....
But where&rsquo;s the wit now, Club? Have you found it?</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Club.</i> Egad, master, I think &rsquo;tis a very good jest.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Mock.</i> What?</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Club.</i> Why, drinking. You&rsquo;ll find, master, that this same
gentleman in the straw doublet, this same Will o&rsquo; the Wisp, is a
wit at the bottom. Here, here, master, how it puns and quibbles in
the glass!<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Mock.</i> By the universe, now I have it; the wit lies in the
jingling! All wit consists most in jingling. Hear how the glasses
rhyme to one another.... I fancy this same wine is all sold at
Will&rsquo;s Coffee-house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Here we have a palpable hit at the source of inspiration indulged in
by many of the wits and rhymesters who gathered round &lsquo;glorious John
Dryden&rsquo; within the hallowed walls of that famous rendezvous. And likely
enough, when they</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;were all at supper, all in good humour, Champaign was the
word, and wit flew about the room like a pack of losing cards.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Farquhar seems, above all others, to have hailed the new wine with
pleasure. We all remember the &lsquo;red Burgundy&rsquo; which saves Mirabel from
his perilous position in the cut-throats&rsquo; den; but the flighty hero of
the <em>Inconstant</em> is equally enthusiastic over sparkling wine when he
exclaims:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;Give me the plump Venetian, brisk and sanguine, that smiles
upon me like the glowing sun, and meets my lips like sparkling
wine, her person shining as the glass, and spirit like the foaming
liquor.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The benignant influence of the beverage is, moreover, referred to by
Farquhar in his epilogue to the <cite>Constant Couple</cite>, where, in alluding to
the critics, it is said that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;To coffee some retreat to save their pockets,</div>
      <div class="verse">Others, more generous, damn the play at Locket&rsquo;s;</div>
      <div class="verse">But there, I hope, the author&rsquo;s fears are vain,</div>
      <div class="verse">Malice ne&rsquo;er spoke in generous Champain.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Further, he makes Benjamin Wouldbe exclaim:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;Show me that proud stoick that can bear success and Champain;
philosophy can support us in hard fortune, but who can have
patience in prosperity?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Farquhar shows his usual keen observation of the minutest features of
the life of his day in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
allusion to the flask&mdash;the pear-shaped
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flacon</i> in which Champagne made its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> into fashionable
life.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Archer, in his ditty on &lsquo;trifles,&rsquo; thus warbles:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;A flask of Champaign, people think it</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">A trifle, or something as bad;</div>
      <div class="verse">But if you&rsquo;ll contrive how to drink it,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">You&rsquo;ll find it no trifle, egad!&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Congreve, in evident reference to the still wine, thus writes to Mr.
Porter, husband of the celebrated actress, from Calais, August 11, 1700:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;Here is admirable Champaign for twelvepence a quart, as good
Burgundy for fifteenpence; and yet I have virtue enough to resolve
to leave this place to-morrow for St. Omers, where the same wine is
half as dear again, and may be not quite so good.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Champagne suffered like other French wines from the War of Succession
and the Methuen Treaty, by which the Government strove to pour Port
wine down the throats of the people. The poets and satirists, supported
by Dean Aldrich, &lsquo;the Apostle of Bacchus;&rsquo; the miserly Dr. Ratcliffe,
who ascribed all diseases to the lack of French wines, and imputed the
badness of the vintages he was wont to place upon his table to the
difficulty he experienced in obtaining them; the jovial Portman Seymour;
the rich &lsquo;smell-feast&rsquo; Pereira and General Churchill, Marlborough&rsquo;s
brother, together with a host of &lsquo;bottle companions,&rsquo; lawyers, and
physicians, united to fight against this attempt.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> They would drink
their old favourites, in spite of treaties, and would praise them as
they deserved; and means were found to gratify their wishes. According
to official returns, the nominal importation of French wines fell in
1701 to a trifle over two thousand tons; and though this quantity was
only once exceeded up to 1786, the influence of a steady demand, a short
sea-passage, an extensive coast-line, and a ridiculously inefficient
preventive service in aid of the high duty need to be taken into
consideration. The contraband traders of the beginning of the century
smuggled French wine into England, just as they continued to do at
a later period into Scotland and Ireland, when the taste for ardent
spirits which sprang up in the Georgian era rendered the surreptitious
import of &lsquo;Nantz&rsquo; and &lsquo;Geneva&rsquo; the more profitable transaction as
regarded England. Farquhar throws light on one method pursued when
Colonel Standard hands Alderman Smuggler his pocket-book, which he had
dropped, with the remark:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;It contains an account of some secret practices in your
merchandising, amongst the rest, the counterpart of an agreement
with a correspondent at Bordeaux about transporting French wine in
Spanish casks.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>That the Champenois were themselves aware of the appreciation in which
their wine was held in England is shown by a passage in Coffin&rsquo;s
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campania vindicata</cite>. Writing in 1712, the year before the ratification
of the Treaty of Utrecht, he calls on the Britons in presence of
returning peace to cross the seas, and instead of lavishing their wealth
to pleasure blood-stained Mars, to fill their ships with the treasures
of the Remois Bacchus, and bear home these precious spoils instead of
fatal trophies.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Addison, referring to one source whence French wines were derived,
remarks:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;There is in this City a certain fraternity of Chymical
Operators who work underground, in holes, caverns, and dark
retirements, to conceal their mysteries from the eyes and
observation of mankind. These subterraneous Philosophers are daily
employed in the Transmigration of Liquors, and, by the power of
Magical Drugs and Incantations, raise under the streets of <em>London</em>
the choicest products of the hills and valleys of <em>France</em>. They
can squeeze <em>Bourdeaux</em> out of a <em>Sloe</em>, and draw <em>Champagne</em> from
an <em>Apple</em>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>He tells us that</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;the person who appeared against them was a Merchant, who had
by him a great magazine of wines, that he had laid in before the
war: but these Gentlemen (as he said) had so vitiated the nation&rsquo;s
palate, that no man could believe his to be <em>French</em>, because it
did not taste like what they sold for such.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For the defence it was urged that</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;they were under a necessity of making Claret if they would
keep open their doors, it being the nature of Mankind to love
everything that is Prohibited.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The enquiry,</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;And where would your beaux have Champaign to toast their
mistresses were it not for the merchant?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>is from a panegyrist of the more legitimate school of trade.</p>

<p>Altogether it is tolerably certain that Champagne&mdash;genuine or
fictitious, from grape or gooseberry&mdash;played a more important part in
the conviviality of the early portion of the eighteenth century than
might be supposed from the imports of the epoch, whilst there is little
doubt but that it helped to inspire some of the finest productions of
the Augustan age of English literature.</p>

<p>Gay places it first amongst the wines offered to a party of guests
entering a tavern, making the drawer exclaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Name, sirs, the wine that most invites your taste,</div>
      <div class="verse">Champaign or Burgundy, or Florence pure,</div>
      <div class="verse">Or Hock antique, or Lisbon new or old,</div>
      <div class="verse">Bourdeaux, or neat French wine, or Alicant.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This reference to Champagne most likely relates to the still wine; but
it is probably the sparkling variety which is alluded to in the verses
which Gay addressed to Pope on the completion of the <cite>Iliad</cite> in 1720,
and wherein he represents General Wilkinson thus apostrophising as the
ship conveying the poet passes Greenwich:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Come in, my friends, here shall ye dine and lie;</div>

      <div class="verse">And sup and breakfast on (if ye comply),</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">For I have still some dozens of Champaign.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Witty Mat Prior, poet and diplomatist, was always ready to manifest his
contempt for the heavy fluid with which the Methuen treaty deluged our
island in place of the light fresh-tasting wines of France that had
cheered and inspired his earlier sallies. Writing whilst in custody on a
charge of treason between 1715 and 1717, and referring to the mind under
the name of Alma, he tells us how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;By nerves about our palate placed,</div>
      <div class="verse">She likewise judges of the taste,</div>
      <div class="verse">Else (dismal thought!) our warlike men</div>
      <div class="verse">Might drink thick Port for fine Champagne.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He likewise inculcates a lesson of philosophy, especially suited to his
own situation at that moment, when he remarks of fortune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;I know we must both fortunes try,</div>
      <div class="verse">And bear our evils, wet or dry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></div>
      <div class="verse">Yet, let the goddess smile or frown,</div>
      <div class="verse">Bread we shall eat, or white or brown;</div>
      <div class="verse">And in a cottage or a court</div>
      <div class="verse">Drink fine Champagne or muddled Port.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There were many, no doubt, ready to emulate the hero of one of his minor
pieces, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent55">&lsquo;from this world to retreat</div>
      <div class="verse">As full of Champagne as an egg&rsquo;s full of meat.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></div>

<p>Shenstone gives expression to much the same sentiment as Prior when he
found &lsquo;his warmest welcome at an inn,&rsquo; and wrote on the window-pane at
Henley:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis here with boundless power I reign,</div>

</div>

<p>Vanbrugh, whose writings were of a decidedly lighter character than the
edifices he erected, probably had recourse to Champagne to assist him
in the composition of the former, and neglected it when planning the
designs for the latter. These, indeed, would seem to have been conceived under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the influence of some such &lsquo;heavy muddy stuff&rsquo; as the &lsquo;Norfolk
nog,&rsquo; which Lady Headpiece reproaches her husband for allowing their son
and heir to indulge in, saying:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;Well, I wonder, Sir Francis, you will encourage that lad
to swill such beastly lubberly liquor. If it were Burgundy or
Champaign, something might be said for&rsquo;t; they&rsquo;d perhaps give him
some art and spirit.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Swift has given in his <cite>Journal to Stella</cite> extensive information as
to the wines in vogue in London in 1710&ndash;13. He seems for his own part
to have been, as far as nature permitted him, an accommodating toper,
indulging, in addition to Champagne, in Tokay, Portugal, Florence,
Burgundy, Hermitage, &lsquo;Irish wine,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> Claret, &lsquo;right French
wine,&rsquo; Congreve&rsquo;s &lsquo;nasty white wine&rsquo; that gave him the heartburn, and
Sir William Read&rsquo;s &lsquo;admirable punch.&rsquo; He acknowledges that the more
fashionable beverages of the day were not to his taste. &lsquo;I love,&rsquo; writes
he, &lsquo;white Portugal wine better than Claret, Champaign, or Burgundy. I
have a sad vulgar appetite.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Still, while observing due moderation,
he did not entirely shun the lighter potations with which the table of
the luxurious and licentious St. John was so freely supplied. On one
occasion he writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;I dined to-day by appointment with Lord Bolingbroke; but they
fell to drinking so many Spanish healths in Champaign, that I stole
away to the ladies and drank tea till eight.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>And on another we find him refusing to allow his host to</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;drink one drop of Champaign or Burgundy without water.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Our countrymen do not appear to have taken heed of the controversy
regarding the respective merits of Champagne and Burgundy, but
thankfully accepted the goods that the gods and the sunny soil of France
provided them. The accusation, however, banded about by the partisans of
these rival vintages, of their tendency to produce gout, had apparently
been accepted as gospel truth over here in the first decade of the
century. Thus the Dean notes that he</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;dined with Mr. Secretary St. John, and staid till seven,
but would not drink his Champaign and Burgundy, for fear of the
gout.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>When suffering from a rheumatic pain he displays commendable caution at
dinner with Mr. Domville, only drinking</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;three or four glasses of Champaign by perfect teasing,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>for fear of aggravating his suffering. He is prompt, however, to
acknowledge himself mistaken:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;I find myself disordered with a pain all round the small of
my back, which I imputed to Champaign I had drunk, but find it to
have been only my new cold.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The Dean does not appear to have been the only sufferer, for we find him
writing:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;I called this evening to see Mr. Secretary, who had been
very ill with the gravel and pains in his back, by Burgundy and
Champaign, added to the sitting up all night at business; I found
him drinking tea, while the rest were at Champaign, and was very
glad of it.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>Even Pope, the perforcedly abstemious, was lured into similar excesses
by the young Earl of Warwick and Colley Cibber, during his visits to

<p>A proof of the popularity of French wines at this period is found
in the fact that in 1713, the year of the Peace of Utrecht, the
registered imports, despite high duties, reached 2551 tuns, an amount
not exceeded till 1786. The Treaty of Commerce, with which Bolingbroke
(whose partiality to Champagne we have seen) and M. de Torcy sought to
supplement that of Peace, having fallen through,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the tavern-keepers
put such a price on these wines that it was only members of the
fashionable world who could afford to have what was termed &lsquo;a good
Champagne stomach.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Their vogue is confirmed by the order given to

<p>The registered imports of the wines of France&mdash;though figures in this
respect are, we admit, exceedingly deceptive&mdash;show a continuous falling
off, which reached its lowest ebb in 1746, during war time; and we may
be certain that when, after supper,</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;Champagne was the word for two whole hours by Shrewsbury
clock,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>it was at the cost of a pretty penny. Although the recorded imports of
French wines show but little improvement with the return of peace in
1748, we gather from other sources that the Champagne of 1749 met with a
ready market over here, and find Bertin du Rocheret writing exultingly
to his friend, the Marquis de Calvières, that the Champenois were making
the English pay the cost of the war.</p>

<p>The voluminous correspondence of Bertin du Rocheret gives some curious
information as to the manner in which the Champagne trade was carried
on with England during the second quarter of the eighteenth century.
From 1725 to 1754 he was in constant communication with Mr. James
Chabane, who seems to have been the Court wine-merchant, and to whom
he despatched at first ten, but during the latter portion of their
transactions seldom more than four, pièces of wine annually during
the winter months.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> As regards the particular vintage consumed in
England, a preference evidently existed for that of Ay, though it really
appears as if Bertin was wont to introduce under this name the then far
cheaper growths of Avize. Such, at any rate, seems to have been the case
with the parcel of wine divided, in 1754, between King George in London
and King Stanislas at Nancy. Referring to the wines of Hautvillers and
Sillery, Bertin writes to Chabane in 1731, that a year&rsquo;s notice must be
given in advance to obtain them. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreux</i> wine was then preferred,
as in 1732 he remarks, respecting the yield of the preceding year, that
the English are as mad after <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liqueur</i> as the French; and it is evident
that the taste continued, as in 1744 he announces the departure for
London of eleven poinçons <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liquoreux</i>.</p>

<p>Not only was Chabane accustomed to bottle these wines, but while doing
so was able to insure to them a semi-sparkling character. With this view
Bertin tells him, in 1731, that he must not keep them in cask after the
three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sèves</i>, or motions of the sap of April, June, or August, except
in the case of a pièce from &lsquo;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clos</i>&rsquo; reserved &lsquo;for the supply of the
Court,&rsquo; and intended to be drunk as still wine. Some wine despatched
in 1754 is recommended to be bottled during the first quarter of the
moon.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> In addition to the wine thus sent in casks, Bertin was also
accustomed to send his correspondent a certain quantity in bottles.
In 1725 he quotes for him &lsquo;flacons blancs mousseux liqueur,&rsquo; at from
30 to 50 sols, and &lsquo;ambrés non-mousseux sablant,&rsquo; at 25 sols. These
flasks were all despatched to Dunkirk or into Holland, whence they were
smuggled to their ultimate destination, for the introduction of wine in
bottles into England was rigidly prohibited until the close of 1745,
when it was legalised by Act of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Horace Walpole, who deals with men rather than manners, with sayings
rather than doings, and whose forte is epigram and not description, has
little to tell us about the drinking customs of his day. The strictly
temperate regimen that marked his later years, and rendered him unfit
for mere convivial gatherings, extended to his writings, and he seldom
permits his pen to expatiate on those pleasures in which he sought no
share. Even in his letters from Reims, written in 1739, when he was
doing the grand tour, he omits all mention of the wine for which that
city is famed. Still he incidentally furnishes a few instances of the
esteem in which Champagne was held by the upper classes in the middle
of the eighteenth century. In a letter to George Montague, dated June
23, 1750, he describes how Lord Granby joined his party at Vauxhall
whilst suffering considerably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
under the influence of the Champagne he
had consumed at &lsquo;Jenny&rsquo;s Whim,&rsquo; a noted tavern at Chelsea; and writing
to Sir Horace Mann, a year later, he says that the then chief subjects
of conversation in London were the two Miss Gunnings and an extravagant
dinner at White&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;The dinner was a frolic of seven young men, who bespoke it to
the utmost extent of expense; one article was a tart made of duke
cherries, from a hothouse; and another, that they tasted but one
glass out of each bottle of Champagne. The bill of fare has got
into print, and with good people has produced the apprehension of
another earthquake.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>The Earl of March, afterwards &lsquo;Old Q,&rsquo; in a letter to Walpole&rsquo;s friend,
George Selwyn, in November 1766, writes: &lsquo;I have not yet received
some Champaign that Monsieur de Prissieux has sent me.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> And we
find Horace Walpole&rsquo;s fair foe, that eighteenth-century exemplar of
strong-minded womanhood, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, whose letters
indicate a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> for Burgundy, acknowledging in verse the
exhilarating effects of Champagne. Of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux</i> of 1721 she says that</p>

<p>During the third quarter of the eighteenth century a cloud dims the
lustre of Champagne. It was then looked upon by a vast majority as
only a fit accompaniment to masquerades, ridottos, ultra-fashionable
dinners, and Bacchanalian suppers. &lsquo;The Champaign made some eyes sparkle
that nothing else could brighten,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> says the contemporary account
of one of those scenes of shameless revelry held under the title of
masquerades at the Pantheon, and the orgies that, under the auspices
of Mrs. Cornelys, disgraced Carlisle House were mainly inspired by the
consumption of the same wine. The citizens of the Georgian era, who had
lost the tastes of their fathers, hated French wines simply because
they were French; and the hundred thousand gallons imported on an
average annually from 1750 to 1786 were entirely consumed amongst the
upper or the dissipated classes. Though smuggling was still looked upon
as patriotic, if not loyal, those engaged in it had discovered that,
thanks to the combined effects of duty and demand, Nantes brandy and
Hollands gin paid better. What, indeed, is to be thought of the taste
of an era that produced poets whose muse sought inspiration in punch,
and who had the sublime audacity to extol the rum of the West Indies
above the produce of &lsquo;Marne&rsquo;s flowery banks&rsquo;?<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Only a few of the
higher-class men, however, engaged in literature and art seem to have
retained a preference for French wine. The accounts of the Literary
Club established by Sir Joshua Reynolds show the average consumption at
each sitting to have been half a bottle of Port and a bottle of Claret
per head. Johnson drank Port mixed with sugar from about 1752 to 1764;
became a total abstainer until 1781, and then seems to have given the
preference to Madeira.</p>

<p>In contemporaneous comedy we are pretty sure to find the mirror held
up to fashion, if not to Nature; and turning to the playwrights of
that day, it is easy to cull a few confirmatory excerpts. Thus we have
Sterling, the ambitious British merchant, in order to do honour to his
noble guests, preparing to</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;give them such a glass of Champaign as they never drank in
their lives; no, not at a duke&rsquo;s table.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>While Lord Minikin, the peer of fashion, makes his entrance on the
stage, exclaiming:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;O my head! I must absolutely change my wine-merchant; I

week.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>On Miss Tittup inquiring if his depression is due to losses at cards, he

<p>Jessamy, his lordship&rsquo;s valet, profits of course by so aristocratic an
example; and when speaking of his exploits at the masquerade, says,</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;I was in tip-top spirits, and had drunk a little too freely

<p>We greet, too, what was perhaps the first appearance of a joke now
grown venerable in its antiquity in a farce of Foote&rsquo;s, the scene of
which is laid at Bath. He introduces us to a party of pseudo-invalids
devoting their whole time and attention to conviviality, recruiting
their debilitated stomachs with turtle and venison, and alternating Bath
waters with the choicest vintages, so that the hero Racket is fain to
observe to one of them,</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;My dear Sir Kit, how often has Dr. Carawitchet told you that
your rich food and Champaigne would produce nothing but poor health
and real pain?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>And how many gentlemen in difficulties have not since followed the
example set by Harry Dornton in the spunging-house, and ordered, as a
consolation,</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;a bottle of Champagne and two rummers&rsquo;!<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Turning from fancy to fact, we find Sir Edward Barry furnishing some
particulars respecting the Champagne wines consumed in England during
the latter half of the last century.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> He informs us at the outset
that</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;the wines of Champaign and Burgundy are made with more care
than any other French wines; and the vaults in which the former are
preserved are better than any other in France. These wines, from
their finer texture and peculiar flavour, cannot be adulterated
without the fraud being easily discovered, and are therefore
generally imported pure, or by proper care may be certainly
procured in that state.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His remarks evidently refer to the still wines, as he proceeds to
explain that &lsquo;the Champaign River
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Wines are more delicate and pale than
those which are distinguished from them by the name of Mountain gray
Wines,&rsquo; the latter being more durable and better suited for exportation,
whilst the former, if allowed to remain too long in the cask, acquire a
taste from the wood, although keeping in flasks from four to six years
without harm. Referring to the taste of the day, he explains that</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;among the River Wines the Auvillers and Epernay are most
esteemed, and among the Mountain Wines the Selery and St. Thyery,
and in general such as are of the colour of a partridge&rsquo;s eye.
These are likewise distinguished for their peculiar grateful
pungency and balsamic softness, which is owing to the refined
saline principle which prevails more in them than in the Burgundy
Wines, on which account they are less apt to affect the head,
communicate a milder heat, and more freely pervade and pass through
the vessels of the body.... To drink Champaign Wines in the
greatest perfection, the flask should be taken from the vault a
quarter of an hour before it is drunk, and immersed in ice-water,
with the cork so loose in it as is sufficient to give a free
passage to the air, and yet prevent too great an evaporation of its
spirituous parts.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing practice still obtains with Sillery, classed by Barry as
the first of the Mountain growths, and in the highest favour in England
throughout the remainder of the century. Regarding sparkling wine, of
which he was evidently no admirer, he adds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;For some years the French and English have been particularly
fond of the sparkling frothy Champaigns. The former have almost
entirely quitted that depraved taste, nor does it now so much
prevail here. They used to mix some ingredients to give them that
quality; but this is unnecessary, as they are too apt spontaneously
to run into that state; but whoever chooses to have such Wines may
be assured that they will acquire it by bottling them any time
after the vintage before the month of the next May; and the most
sure rule to prevent that disposition is not to bottle them before
the November following. This rule has been confirmed by repeated
experiments.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the signature of the Treaty of Peace with France in 1783, it had
been stipulated that a Treaty of Commerce should likewise be concluded;
and in 1786, under the auspices of Pitt, a treaty of this character was
made, the first article providing that &lsquo;The wines of France imported
directly from France into Great Britain shall in no case pay any
higher duties than those which the wines of Portugal now pay.&rsquo; Pitt,
spite of his well known <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> for Port, had yet a sneaking liking
for Champagne, arising no doubt from his early familiarity with the
wine when he went to Reims to study, after leaving the University of
Cambridge. It was with Champagne that he was primed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the memorable
occasion when he, Lord Chancellor Thurlow, and Mr. Secretary Dundas
galloped after dusk through an open turnpike-gate without paying toll,
and only just missed receiving the contents of a loaded blunderbuss,
which the turnpike man, fancying they were highwaymen, fired after them.
The party had been dining with the President of the Board of Trade at
Addiscombe, and a rhymester of the epoch commemorated the incident in

<p>Brooks&rsquo; Club enjoyed a high reputation for its Champagne, and we find
Fighting Fitzgerald emptying three bottles there without assistance, the
same evening on which he bullied the members into electing him.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>The year after the Treaty of Commerce was signed, we have an anonymous
writer remarking<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> that in time of peace the English drew large
quantities of wine from Bordeaux and Nantes, and that the other French
wines they were in the habit of consuming were those of Mantes,
Burgundy, and Champagne, shipped respectively from Rouen, Dunkirk, and
Calais. Arthur Young, writing at the same time, remarks, <em>apropos</em>
of Champagne, that the trade with England &lsquo;used to be directly from
Epernay; but now the wine is sent to Calais, Boulogne, Montreuil,
and Guernsey, in order to be passed into England they suppose here
by smuggling. This may explain our Champagne not being so good as
formerly.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> It is to be hoped that neither Arthur Young nor other
connoisseurs of Champagne had been enticed into drinking as the genuine
article any of the produce of the vineyard which the Hon. Charles
Hamilton had planted with the Auvernat grape near Cobham, in Surrey, and
which was said to yield a wine &lsquo;resembling Champagne.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>The reduction of duty consequent upon the treaty as a matter of course
largely increased the importation of French wine. Respecting the taste
for Champagne then prevailing in England, and the price the wine
commanded, a few interesting particulars are afforded by the early
correspondence and account-books of Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon of Epernay,
which we have courteously been permitted to inspect. From these we find
that in October 1788 the Chevalier Colebrook, writing in French to
the firm from Bath, asks that seventy-two bottles of Champagne may be
sent to his friend, the Hon. John Butler of Molesworth-street, Dublin,
&lsquo;who, if content with the wine, will become a very good customer, being
rich, keeping a good house, and receiving many amateurs of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin de
Champagne</i>.&rsquo; The writer is no doubt the &lsquo;M. Collebrock&rsquo; to whom the firm
shortly afterwards forward fifty bottles of &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin non mousseux</i>, 1783,&rsquo;
on his own account. Messrs. Carbonnell, Moody, &amp; Walker, predecessors of
the well-known existing firm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Carbonnell &amp; Co., London, in a letter
dated November 1788, and also written in French, say: &lsquo;If you can supply
us with some Champagne of a very good body, not too much charged with
liqueur, but with an excellent flavour, and not at all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moussu</i>, we beg
you to send two ten dozen baskets. Also, if you have any dry Champagne
of very good flavour, solidity, and excellent body, send two baskets of
the same size.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The taste of the day was evidently for a full-bodied non-sparkling wine;
and this is confirmed by Jeanson, Messrs. Moët&rsquo;s traveller in England,
who writes from London in May 1790: &lsquo;How the taste of this country has
altered within the last ten years! Almost everywhere they ask for a dry
wine; but they want a wine so vinous and so strong, that there is hardly
anything but Sillery that will satisfy them.&rsquo; Additional confirmation
is found in a letter, written from London in May 1799 to Messrs.
Moët, by a Mr. John Motteux, complaining of delay in the delivery of
a parcel of wine said to have been sent off by way of Havre, and very
likely destined to be surreptitiously introduced into England <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i>
Guernsey. He asks for a further supply of Sillery, if its safe arrival
can be guaranteed, and remarks, &lsquo;There is nothing to be compared to
Sillery when it is genuine; it must not have the least sweetness nor
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousse</i>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>During the great French war, patriotism and increased duties might have
been expected to check the import of French wines; yet, if statistics
are worth anything, the reverse would appear to have been the case.
The registered imports, which from 1770 to 1786 had fluctuated between
80,000 and 125,000 gallons, rose during the last fourteen years of the
century to an average of 550,000 gallons per annum. In those fighting,
rollicking, hard-drinking times, when it was a sacred social duty to
toast &lsquo;great George our King&rsquo; on every possible occasion, Champagne
continued to be &lsquo;the wine of fashion.&rsquo; The sparkling variety was
terribly costly, no doubt, and was often doled out, as Mr. Walker
relates, &lsquo;like drops of blood.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> But whilst the stanch admirers of
Port might profess to despise Champagne as effeminate, and the &lsquo;loyal
volunteers&rsquo; condemn it as the produce of a foeman&rsquo;s soil, there were
plenty to sing in honour of &lsquo;The Fair of Britain&rsquo;s Isle:&rsquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, the greatest of England&rsquo;s naval heroes was not insensible to the
attractions of this gift from &lsquo;our sweet enemy France.&rsquo; In October 1800
Nelson, together with Sir William and Lady Hamilton, was a guest of Mr.
Elliot, the British Resident at Dresden. At dinner Lady Hamilton drank
more Champagne than the narrator of this little incident imagined it
was possible for a woman to consume, and inspired thereby, insisted on
favouring the company with her imitations of classical statuary. Nelson
thereupon got uproarious, and went on emptying bumper after bumper of
the same fluid in honour of the fair Emma, and swearing that she was
superior to Siddons. The host kept striving &lsquo;to prevent the further
effusion of Champagne,&rsquo; but did not succeed till Sir William in his turn
had astonished all present with a display of his social talents. The
grave diplomatist lay down on his back, with his arms and legs in the
air, and in this position bounded all round the room like a ball, with
his stars and ribbons flying around him.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>His sometime model and subsequent victim, poor Brummell, is said to
have put the wine to a still more ignoble use. One day a youthful beau
approached the great master in the arts of dress and deportment, and
said, &lsquo;Permit me to ask you where you get your blacking?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; replied
Brummell, gazing complacently at his boots, &lsquo;my blacking positively
ruins me. I will tell you in confidence it is made with the finest
Champagne.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Probably the great dandy was merely quizzing his
interlocutor, though such an act of extravagance would have been a pull
on even the longest purse in those days, &lsquo;your bottle of Champagne in

<p>As to the Prince Regent&rsquo;s brothers, we know that the Duke of York
was such a powerful toper, that &lsquo;six bottles of Claret after dinner
scarce made a perceptible change in his countenance,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and remember
the Duke of Clarence making his appearance at the table of the Royal
household at Windsor, and getting so helplessly drunk on Champagne as
to be utterly incapable of keeping his promise to open the ball that
evening with his sister Mary.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Two prominent orators of that day are
credited with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mots</i> upon Champagne. Curran said, <em>apropos</em> of the rapid
but transient intoxication produced by this wine, that &lsquo;Champagne made a
runaway rap at a man&rsquo;s head;&rsquo; while Canning maintained that any man who
said he really liked dry Champagne simply lied.</p>

<p>After Waterloo, although a few <em>gourmets</em> continued to prefer the
still wine, sparkling Champagne became the almost universally accepted
variety. Nevertheless, Henderson, while noting that &lsquo;by Champagne wine
is usually understood a sparkling or frothy liquor,&rsquo; gives the foremost
place to the wine of Sillery, which, he remarks, &lsquo;has always been in
much request in England, probably on account of its superior strength
and durable quality.&rsquo; He extols the Ay wine as &lsquo;an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
exquisite liquor,
lighter and sweeter than the Sillery, and accompanied by a delicate
flavour and aroma somewhat analogous to that of the pine-apple.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>The poets of the first half of the present century have hardly done
justice to Champagne. Tom Moore, the most Anacreontic of them all,
although ready, like his Grecian prototype, to &lsquo;pledge the universe in
wine,&rsquo; the merits of which he was continually chanting in the abstract,
has seldom been so invidious as to particularise any especial vintage.
Champagne, the wine of all others best fitted to inspire his bright
and sparkling lyrics, has received but scant attention in his earlier
productions. Bob Fudge, writing from Paris in 1818, is made to speak
approvingly of Beaune and Chambertin, but only mentions Champagne as a
vehicle in which to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauter</i> kidneys;<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and in the <cite>Sceptic</cite> it is
simply brought in to point a moral respecting the senses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Habit so mars them, that the Russian swain</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In two instances only the poet who sang in such lively numbers of woman
and wine pointedly refers to the vintage of the Champagne. One is when
he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Moore&rsquo;s Diary, however, proves that if he did not care to praise
the wine in verse, it was not for want of opportunities of becoming
acquainted with it. Witness his &lsquo;odd dinner in a borrowed room&rsquo; at
Horace Twiss&rsquo;s in Chancery-lane, with the strangely incongruous
accompaniments of &lsquo;Champagne, pewter spoons, and old Lady Cork.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As to that most convivial of songsters, Captain Charles Morris,
poet-laureate of the Ancient Society of Beefsteaks, he labours under
a similar reproach. Though he has filled several hundred octavo pages
of his <cite>Lyra Urbanica</cite> with verses in praise of wine, the liquor with
which he crowns &lsquo;the mantling goblet,&rsquo; &lsquo;the fancy-stirring bowl,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;the soul-subliming cup,&rsquo; usually figures under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
some such fanciful
designation as &lsquo;the inspiring juice,&rsquo; &lsquo;the cordial of life,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Bacchus&rsquo; balm.&rsquo; Champagne he evidently ignores as a beverage of
Gallic origin, utterly unfitted for the praise of so true a Briton as
himself; and the only vintage which he does condescend to mention with
approbation is the favourite one of our beef-eating, hard-drinking,
frog-hating forefathers, &lsquo;old Oporto&rsquo; from &lsquo;the stout Lusitanian vine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, the manlier Muse of Scott used at times to dip
her wing into the Champagne cup, although she has failed to express any
verbal gratitude to this source of inspiration. &lsquo;In truth,&rsquo; says his
biographer, &lsquo;he liked no wines except sparkling Champaign and Claret;
but even as to this last he was no connoisseur, and sincerely preferred
a tumbler of whisky-toddy to the most precious liquid ruby that ever
flowed in the cup of a prince. He rarely took any other potation when
alone with his family; but at the Sunday board he circulated the
Champaign briskly during dinner, and considered a pint of Claret each
man&rsquo;s fair share afterwards.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Scott himself, wearied with a round
of London festivities, is impelled to write, &lsquo;I begin to tire of my
gaieties. I wish for a sheep&rsquo;s head and whisky-toddy against all the
French cookery and Champaign in the world.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Lockhart, in his
<cite>Life of Scott</cite>, notes the excellent flavour of some Champagne sent to
Abbotsford by a French admirer of the Northern Wizard in return for a
set of his works, and more than once incidentally refers to the presence
of the wine at Scott&rsquo;s table on festive gatherings.</p>

<p>Byron, who furnished in the course of his career a practical
exemplification of the maxim that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>did the vintage of the Marne justice in his verses. In <cite>Don Juan</cite> he

<p>Although we find Henderson remarking, in 1822, that</p>

<p class="blockquot">&lsquo;the pink Champagne is less in request than the colourless,
and has in fact nothing to entitle it to the preference,&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>yet wine of this tint continued to reappear from time to time, securing
a transitory popularity from its attractive appearance, which caused
it to be likened to the dying reflection of the setting sun on a clear
stream. An interesting incident in connection with its advent on one
of these occasions at the table of Rogers, the banker-poet, has been
recorded by Mr. R. A. Tracy Gould of the American Bar. He was dining,
it seems, in company with Tom Moore and John Kenyon, with Rogers at
St. James&rsquo;s-place, when their host, who had recently received through
the French Ambassador a present of a case of pink Champagne from Louis
Philippe, had the first bottle of it produced at the end of the dinner.
The saucer-shaped Champagne glasses were then just coming into use, and
pink Champagne, which was a revived novelty in England at that moment,
looked singularly beautiful in them, crowned with its snow-white foam.
Kenyon, who, as Gould remarks, was nothing if not declamatory, held up
his glass, and apostrophised it as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Lily on liquid roses floating!</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">So floats yon foam o&rsquo;er pink Champagne!</div>
      <div class="verse">Fain would I join such pleasant boating,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And prove that ruby main,</div>
      <div class="verse indent15">And float away on wine!&rsquo;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This being vociferously applauded, after a few minutes&rsquo; pause he added
the second verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Those seas are dangerous, graybeards swear,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Whose sea-beach is the goblet&rsquo;s brim;</div>
      <div class="verse">And here it is they drown dull Care&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">But what care we for him?</div>
      <div class="verse indent15">So we but float on wine!&rsquo;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On being desired to continue, Kenyon declared that he had done his part,
and that it was now the turn of some one else. Moore and Rogers both
claimed exemption, as being on the &lsquo;retired list&rsquo; of the Parnassian
army, and peremptorily demanded a contribution from the Transatlantic
guest, Tracy Gould, who thereupon, with &lsquo;great diffidence,&rsquo; as he tells
us, delivered himself of the third and fourth stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">

<p>Kenyon then added another stanza, which suggested a final verse to the
American:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;And though &rsquo;tis true they cross in pain,</div>

      <div class="verse indent15">That dips itself in wine!&rsquo;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By this time the inspiration and the Champagne were alike exhausted.</p>

<p>The history of Champagne in England during the latter half of the
present century may be briefly summed up in the assertion of the
ever-growing popularity of the wine, and the high repute attained
by certain brands, which it would be invidious to particularise.
Its success in oiling the wheels of social life is so great and so
universally acknowledged that its eclipse would almost threaten a
collapse of our social system. We cannot open a railway, launch a
vessel, inaugurate a public edifice, start a newspaper, entertain a
distinguished foreigner, invite a leading politician to favour us with
his views on things in general, celebrate an anniversary, or specially
appeal on behalf of a benevolent institution without a banquet, and
hence without the aid of Champagne, which, at the present day, is the
obligatory adjunct of all such repasts.</p>

<p>When the Municipality of London welcome the Khan of Kamschatka to our
shores and to the Guildhall, Champagne flows in the proverbial buckets
full. When the Master and Wardens of the Coalscuttle-Makers&rsquo; Company bid
the Livery to one of their periodical feasts, scandal says that even
this measure is exceeded. When Sir Fusby Guttleton gives one of his
noted &lsquo;little spreads&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
at Greenwich, are not torrents of iced &lsquo;dry&rsquo;
needed to quench the thirst excited by the devilled bait? Aware, too, of
the unloosening effect the wine exercises upon the strings of both heart
and purse, Pomposo, as chairman at the annual festival of the Decayed
Muffinmongers&rsquo; Asylum, is careful to see that the glasses of the guests
have been well charged with it before he commences his stirring appeal
on behalf of that deserving institution.</p>

<p>Does Ingenioso wish to introduce to the notice of the British public
a new heating-power or lighting-apparatus or ice-making machinery, he
straightway issues cards for a private view to critics and cognoscenti,
and is careful that these shall observe the merits of his invention
through the medium of a glass&mdash;bubbling over with Champagne. So it is
at the openings of the latest extension of the Mugby Junction Railway
and of the Palatial Hotel, at the private view of the Amicable Afghans,
or Tinto&rsquo;s new picture, or any one of Crotchet&rsquo;s manifold inventions.
If the bidding, too, flags at a sale of shorthorns or thoroughbreds, at
a wink from the auctioneer the Champagne-corks are set a-popping, and
advance promptly follows advance in responsive echoes.</p>

<p>Not less important is the part that Champagne plays in the City. Capel
Crash, the great financier, literally <em>floats</em> the concerns he deigns
to &lsquo;promote&rsquo; by its agency. When Consol, the millionaire, makes one of
a set for rigging the market, and the &lsquo;ring&rsquo; thus formed has reaped the
reward of their ingenuity, does he not entertain his intimate friends
with the story and with the choicest Champagne? The amount of business,
moreover, transacted by the aid of the wine is incalculable. Bargains
in stocks and shares, tea and sugar, cotton and corn, hemp and iron,
hides and tallow, broadcloth and shoddy, are clinched by its agency. On
the other hand, many a bit of sharp practice has been forgiven, many a
hard bargain has been forgotten, many a smouldering resentment has been
quenched for ever, and many an enmity healed and a friendship cemented,
over a bottle of Champagne.</p>

<p>The Turf is said to be our national pastime, and no one will deny the
close connection existing between sport and Champagne. From the highest
to the lowest of that wonderful agglomeration of individuals interested
in equine matters, it is recognised as the only standard &lsquo;tipple.&rsquo;
Champagne goes down to the Derby in its hamper-and-four, like other
pertinacious patrons of the race, and its all but ubiquitous presence
on the course is warmly welcomed by thousands of thirsty visitors of
very various grades. At Ascot, does H. R. H. the Prince of Wales seek to
congratulate the Marquis of Hartington on his success, it is by wishing
him further success in a glass of sparkling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
wine. Does Mr. William
Kurr, welsher, desire to make the acquaintance of Mr. Druscovitch,
detective, he seeks an introduction from Mr. Meiklejohn over a bottle
of &lsquo;fiz.&rsquo; Does the favourite horse win&mdash;quick, fill high the bowl with
sparkling wine, to celebrate his triumph; does he lose, the same vintage
will serve to drown our sorrows and obliterate the recollection of our
losses. How many cunning <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coups</i>, how many clever combinations, have
there not been worked out in all their details over a bottle of &lsquo;Cham.&rsquo;
in quiet hotel-parlours at Doncaster or Newmarket! How many bets have
been laid and paid in the same medium! How many a jockey has been
bought, and how many a race has been sold, owing to the moral as well
as physical obliquity of vision which the ingurgitation of the wine has
induced! Nor should the existence of Champagne Stakes be forgotten.
There are now several races of this name at different meetings; but the
oldest is that established at Doncaster in 1828, and taking its title
from the fact of the owner of the winner having to present six dozen of
Champagne to the Doncaster Club.</p>

<p>Look, too, at the influence exercised by the wine on the British drama,
or rather on what to-day passes as such. Plagioso the playwright freely
opens a bottle of Champagne with the object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
stimulating the wit of his friend and collaborateur in the task of
adapting Messrs. Meilhac &amp; Halévy&rsquo;s latest production to the London
stage. Adverse critics, moreover, are said to be mollified by the
subjugating influence of the wine; while authors, enraged at the way in
which their pieces have been &lsquo;cut,&rsquo; are similarly soothed; squabbles
too between rival <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artistes</i> as to parts and lengths are satisfactorily
arranged in the managerial sanctum over a bottle of fiz. Does Lord
Nortiboy wish to smooth over a tiff with the tow-haired young lady who
is making ducks and drakes of his money at the Gynarchic Theatre, and
whose partiality for sparkling wine is notorious, a dinner at Richmond
and floods of &lsquo;Cham&rsquo; for herself and friends is the plan that naturally
suggests itself. Should the enterprising lessees of the Chansonnette
Theatre determine to celebrate the thousand and first night of the run
of <cite>Their Girls</cite>, a Champagne supper is recognised as the fit and proper
method of doing so. Supper is the favourite meal of the profession, and
Champagne is of course the best of all wine to take at that repast. On
the stage itself it has often proved of very serious service. Robust
tragedians and prima
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
donnas in good training may indulge in stout,
as more &lsquo;mellering to the organ;&rsquo; but by the judicious administration
of Champagne many a nervous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutant</i> has been encouraged to conquer
&lsquo;stage fright&rsquo; and to face the footlights, many a jaded <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tragédienne</i>
enabled to rally her fainting energies in the last act, and to carry her
audience with her in a final outburst of pathos or passion.</p>

<p>Statesmen no longer prime themselves with Port before strolling down
to the House, till they get into the condition of the two members, one
of whom averred that he could not see any Speaker in the chair, whilst
the other gravely accounted for the phenomenon of this disappearance
by asserting that, for his part, he saw a couple. Perhaps it is to be
regretted that the records of the &lsquo;tea-room&rsquo; do not vouch for a larger
consumption of Champagne, as then perhaps the reporters overnight and
their readers the nest morning might escape the wearisome reiteration
of purposeless recrimination and threadbare platitudes. Such should
certainly be the case, since the power of the wine as an incentive to
brisk and sparkling conversation has been universally acknowledged in
social life.</p>

<p>To the dinners of Bloomsbury and Belgravia, as well as the suppers of
Bohemia, Champagne imparts a charm peculiarly its own by placing all
there present <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</i>. The modern mind may well look back with
shuddering horror to that dreary period when Champagne, if given at all,
was doled out at dinner-parties &lsquo;like drops of blood.&rsquo; No wonder the
ladies used to fly from the table and the gentlemen to slide underneath
it. And, speaking of the ladies, is not Champagne their wine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
excellence</i>? How would the fragile products of modern civilisation be
able to outdo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the most robust of their ancestresses&mdash;whose highest
saltatory feats were the execution of the slow and stately minuet,
the formal quadrille with its frequent rests, or at most the romping
country dance&mdash;by whirling almost uninterruptedly in the mazes of the
giddy waltz from nine in the evening until five in the morning, without
the sustaining power the sparkling fluid affords them? Has it not on
their tongues an influence equal to that which it exercises on their
swiftly-flying feet, inspiring pretty prattle, sparkling repartee,
enchanting smiles, and silvery laughter? Old Bertin du Rocheret was
quite right when he invited his fair friends to continue drinking</p>

<p>It would certainly be going too far to suggest that flirtation and
Champagne must have been introduced simultaneously, yet the former
can only have attained perfection since the advent of the latter.
Only consider what a failure a picnic or a garden-or water-party, or
any other kind of entertainment to which that much-abused term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête
champêtre</i> is applied, and where flirtation would be, without Champagne!
As a matrimonial agent, Champagne&rsquo;s achievements outdo those of the
cleverest of man&oelig;uvring mammas. It was solely those two extra glasses
at supper which emboldened young Impey Cue of the Foreign Office to
summon up sufficient courage to propose in the conservatory to Miss
Yellowboy, the great heiress; and Impey Cue now lords it at Yellowboy
Park as though to the manor born. Nor must the part it plays on the
eventful day when the fatal knot is firmly tied be overlooked. It has
been cynically remarked that it is a painful spectacle even for the most
hardened to witness the consigning of a victim to the doom matrimonial;
and that it becomes all the more painful when, under the futile pretext
of festivity, bewildered fathers, harassed mothers, sorrowing sisters,
envious cousins, bored connections,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and pitying friends, arrayed in
their best attire, meet at an abnormally early hour round the miscalled
social board. Still, fancy what a wedding breakfast would be without the
accompaniment of Champagne!</p>

<p>With mamma in tears and papa in the fidgets, the bride half-way towards
hysterics, and the bridegroom wishing from the bottom of his heart
that the crowded dining-room would suddenly transform itself into a
securely-locked first-class coupé speeding onwards in the direction
of Dover, the task of those speakers on whom devolves the duty of
descanting upon &lsquo;the happy occasion which has brought us together&rsquo; is of
a surety no easy one. And it would be still more uphill work were it not
for the amount of cheerful inspiration fortunately to be drawn from the familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
foil-topped bottles. By and by, when the more serious speeches
have been duly stammered through, and the jovial bachelor&mdash;a middle-aged
one by preference&mdash;rises to propose &lsquo;the health of the bridesmaids,&rsquo;
bursts of laughter from the men and responsive titters, bubbling up like
the sparkling atoms in the wine which has inspired them, from the lips
of the damsels in question and their compeers, prove beyond question
that Champagne has done its duty in dissipating the gloom originally
prevailing.</p>

<p>A wedding, too, is the customary precursor of other family gatherings

<p class="drop-cap p2">W<span class="smaller">ITH</span> the exception of certain famous vineyards of the Rhône, the
vinelands of the Champagne may, perhaps, be classed among the most
picturesque of the more notable vine-districts of France. Between Paris
and Epernay, even, the banks of the Marne present a series of scenes
of quiet beauty. The undulating ground is everywhere cultivated like a
garden. Handsome châteaux and charming country houses peep out from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
amid luxuriant foliage. Picturesque antiquated villages line the river&rsquo;s
bank or climb the hill-sides, and after leaving La Ferté-sous-Jouarre,
the cradle of the Condés, all the more favoured situations commence to
be covered with vines.</p>

<p>This is especially the case in the vicinity of Château-Thierry&mdash;the
birthplace of La Fontaine&mdash;where the view is shut in on all sides by
vine-clad slopes, which the spring frosts seldom spare. Hence merely one
good vintage out of four gladdens the hearts of the peasant proprietors,
who find eager purchasers for their produce among the lower-class
manufacturers of Champagne. In the same way the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit vin de Chierry</i>,
dexterously prepared and judiciously mingled with other growths, often
figures as &lsquo;Fleur de Sillery&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ay Mousseux.&rsquo; In reality it is not
until we have passed the ornate modern Gothic château of Boursault,
erected in her declining years by the wealthy Veuve Clicquot, by far the
shrewdest manipulator of the sparkling products of Ay and Bouzy of her
day, and the many towers and turrets of which, rising above umbrageous
trees, crown the loftiest height within eyeshot of Epernay, that we find
ourselves in that charmed circle of vineyards whence Champagne&mdash;the
wine, not merely of princes, as it has been somewhat obsequiously
termed, but essentially the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin de société</i>&mdash;is derived.</p>

<p>The vinelands in the vicinity of Epernay, and consequently near the
Marne, are commonly known as the &lsquo;Vineyards of the River,&rsquo; whilst
those covering the slopes in the neighbourhood of Reims are termed the
&lsquo;Vineyards of the Mountain.&rsquo; The Vineyards of the River comprise three
distinct divisions&mdash;first, those lining the right bank of the Marne
and enjoying a southern and south-eastern aspect, among which are Ay,
Hautvillers, Cumières, Dizy, and Mareuil; secondly, the Côte d&rsquo;Epernay
on the left bank of the river, of which Pierry, Moussy, and Vinay form
part; and thirdly, the Côte d&rsquo;Avize (the region <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> of
white grapes), which stretches towards the south-east, and includes the
vinelands of Cramant, Avize, Oger, Le Mesnil, and Vertus. The entire
vineyard area is upwards of 40,000 acres.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>The Champagne vineyards most widely celebrated abroad are those of Ay
and Sillery, although the last named are really the smallest in the
Champagne district. Ay, distant only a few minutes by rail from Epernay,
is in the immediate centre of the Vinelands of the River, having Mareuil
and Avenay on the east, and Dizy, Hautvillers, and Cumières on the west;
while Sillery lies at the foot of the so-called Mountain of Reims, and
within an hour&rsquo;s drive of the old cathedral city.</p>

<p>It was on one of those occasional sunshiny days in the early part of
October<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> when we first visited Ay&mdash;the vineyard of &lsquo;golden plants,&rsquo;
the unique <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier cru</i> of the Wines of the River&mdash;and the various
adjacent vinelands. The road lay between two rows of closely-planted
poplar-trees reaching almost to the village of Dizy, whose quaint gray
church-tower, with its gabled roof, is dominated by the neighbouring
vine-clad slopes, which extend from Avenay to Venteuil, some few miles
beyond Hautvillers, the cradle, so to speak, of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> of
the Champagne. The vineyards of Dizy, the upper soil of which is largely
mixed with loose stones, have chiefly a southern or western aspect,
and, excepting in the case of the precipitous height suggestively
styled &lsquo;Grimpe Chat,&rsquo; their incline is generally a gentle one. In these
vineyards, which rank among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premiers crus</i> of the Champagne, a
quantity of wine from white grapes is regularly made.</p>

<p>From Dizy the road runs immediately at the base of vine-clad slopes,
broken up occasionally by a conical peak detaching itself from the mass,
and tinted from base to summit with richly-variegated hues, among which
deep purple, yellow, green, gray, and crimson by turns predominate.
On our right hand we pass a vineyard called Le Léon, which tradition
asserts to be the one whence Pope Leo the Magnificent, the patron of
Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, and Da Vinci, drew his supply of Ay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
wine. The village of Ay lies immediately before us at the foot of the slopes
of vines, with the tapering spire of its ancient church rising above
the neighbouring hills and cutting sharply against the bright blue sky.
The vineyards, which spread themselves over a calcareous declivity,
have mostly a full southern aspect, and the predominating vines are
those known as golden plants, the fruit of which is of a deep purple
colour. After these comes the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plant vert doré</i>, and then a moderate
proportion of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plant gris</i>, white varieties of grapes being no
longer cultivated as formerly.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Ay vineyards are mentioned in a charter of Edmund of Lancaster, son
of our Henry II. and guardian of Jehanne, heiress of Henri le Gros,
Count of Champagne, dated 1276, and confirming the right of the Abbey
of Avenay to four hogsheads of wine from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terroir</i> of Ay.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> If
faith, however, may be placed in monkish legends, their existence dates
back to the sixth century, at which epoch St. Tresain, the patron saint
of Avenay and a contemporary of St. Remi, emigrated to the Champagne
from Scotland. Having given away all he possessed in charity, he
became perforce a swineherd at Mutigny, a village on the summit of the
hill overlooking Ay, Mareuil, and Avenay. One day the vine-growers of
Ay, hearing that St. Remi was at Ville-en-Selve, sought him out, and
clamorously accused St. Tresain of neglecting to look after his pigs,
which had devastated the vineyards on the slopes, and so caused great
loss to the community. When called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
upon for his defence, St. Tresain
acknowledged that he was wont to listen in the church-porch to the
celebration of mass, and to forget on these occasions all such sublunary
matters as swine. St. Remi, finding him so deeply religious, not only
forgave him his negligence and relieved him from his porcine charge for
the future, but appointed him parish priest of Mareuil and Mutigny, the
inhabitants of which, it is to be hoped, received more attention from
him than his pigs had done. St. Tresain, although his promotion was
brought about by the complaint of the men of Ay, retorted on the latter
in a vindictive and unsaintly spirit, for he ill-naturedly cursed them,
and declared that after thirty years of age not one of them or their
posterity should prosper temporally or spiritually&mdash;a prophecy which, if
it affected the vine-growers of that epoch, has proved harmless enough
in the case of their descendants.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At Ay we visited the pressoir of the principal producer of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i>,
who, although the owner of merely five hectares, or about twelve and
a half acres of vines, expected to make as many as 1500 pièces of
wine that year, mainly of course from grapes purchased from other
growers.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> On our way from Ay to Mareuil, along the lengthy Rue
de Châlons, we looked in at the little auberge at the corner of the
Boulevard du Sud, and found a crowd of coopers and others connected in
some way with the vintage, taking their cheerful glasses round. The
walls of the room were appropriately enough decorated with capering
bacchanals squeezing bunches of purple grapes and flourishing their
thyrsi about in a very tipsy fashion. All the talk&mdash;and there was an
abundance of it&mdash;had reference to the yield of this particular vintage
and the high rate the Ay wine had realised. Eight hundred francs the
pièce of 200 litres, equal to 44 gallons, appeared to be the price fixed
by the agents of the great Champagne houses, and at this figure the bulk
of the vintage was disposed of before a single grape passed through the
winepress.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>The Mareuil vinelands, which include the vineyard bequeathed some
six hundred years ago by Canon John de Brie to the chapter of Reims
cathedral, and possibly those vineyards bestowed in 1208 on the Abbey
of Avenay by Alain de Jouvincourt, cover the slopes of two coteaux,
the first a continuation of the Côte d&rsquo;Ay, and the second a detached
spur, known as the Mont de Fourche, overlooking the Marne canal. Owing
to the steepness of the slopes and to the roads through the vineyards
being impracticable for carts, the grapes were being conveyed to the
press-houses in baskets slung across the backs of mules and donkeys,
most of which, on account of their known partiality for the ripe fruit,
were muzzled while thus employed. The wine yielded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the Mareuil
vineyards possesses body and vinosity, and while of course regarded
as inferior to that of Ay, found a ready market the year of our visit
at from five to six hundred francs the pièce. Prior to the French
Revolution, the produce of the winepresses of the Seigneurs of Mareuil
and the Abbess of Avenay were almost as renowned as the best growths of
Ay. The reputation of the wine was then shared by the inhabitants of the
village; the popular local diction, &lsquo;Les gens d&rsquo;Ay, les messieurs de
Mareuil, et les crottés d&rsquo;Avenay,&rsquo; referring to the days when the first
was inhabited by enriched wine-growers, the second by people of some
position, and the third merely by peasants, simply from its being cut
off, in a great measure, from outside intercourse through the badness
of its approaches. It was not until after 1776, when the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">seigneurie</i>
of Louvois was purchased from the Marquis de Souvré by Madame Adelaïde,
aunt of Louis XVI., that the road from Epernay to Louvois, which
passes through Mareuil and Avenay, was, if not constructed, at any
rate rendered practicable, in order to facilitate the visits of the
princess to her new acquisition. These roads exist, though no traces
remain of the ancient fort of Mareuil on the bank of the Marne, taken
from the English in 1359 by Gaucher de Chatillon, captain of Reims,
and alternately occupied by Leaguers and Royalists during the War of
Religion in the sixteenth century. Nor does there seem any chance of
identifying either the &lsquo;vineyard called la Gibaudelle, lying next the
vineyard of Oudet, surnamed Leclerc,&rsquo; in the territory of Mareuil, which
Guillaume de Lafors and Marguerite his wife bestowed upon the Abbey
of Avenay in 1273, or those from which, in the fourteenth century,
Archbishop Richard Pique of Reims used to draw ten muids or hogsheads of
wine annually for &lsquo;droits de vinage.&rsquo;</p>

      title="Avenay" />

<p class="caption">AVENAY AS SEEN FROM THE RAILWAY.</p>
</div>

<p>The vineyards of Avenay also date prior to the thirteenth century,
mention being frequently made of them in the charters of that
epoch.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Their best wine, which Saint Evremond extolled so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
highly, is vintaged to-day up the slopes of Mont Hurlé. Avenay itself is a
tumbledown little village situated in the direction of Reims, and
the year of our visit we found the yield from its vineyards had been
scarcely more than the third of an average one, and that the wine
produced at the first pressure of the grapes had been sold for 500
francs the pièce. We tasted there some very fair still red wine, made
from the same grapes as Champagne, remarkably deep in colour, full
of body, and possessing that slight sweet bitterish flavour which
characterises certain of the better-class growths of the South of France.</p>

<p>Although at Avenay vineyards cover the slopes as of yore, when Marmontel
used to wander amongst them in company with his inamorata Mademoiselle
Hévin de Navarre, no traces remain of the ancient royal abbey&mdash;founded
by St. Bertha in 660, on the martyrdom of her husband, St. Gombert, one
of the early Christian missionaries to Scotland&mdash;where Charles V. took
up his quarters when invading Champagne in 1544, and where the deputies
of the Leaguers of Reims and of the Royalists of Châlons met in October
1592 to settle the terms of the &lsquo;Traité des Vendanges,&rsquo; securing to both
parties liberty to gather in the vintage unmolested.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> The villagers
still point out the house where Henri Quatre slept, and the window from
which he harangued the populace during the visit paid by him to Madame
Françoise de la Marck, the Abbess of Avenay,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> in August of the same
year. This, by the way, does not seem to have been the only occasion
when the spot was honoured by the presence of Royalty; for a tradition,
which, although unsupported by any documentary evidence, appears to be
worthy of credence, is current to the effect that Marie Antoinette paid
a visit to the Abbey of Avenay during her sojourn at Louvois as the
guest of Madame Adelaïde in 1786. The spring which, according to the
legend, gushed forth when St. Bertha, in imitation of Moses, struck the
rock with her distaff, is still shown to travellers; and scandal has
gone so far as to say that recourse is sometimes had to it to eke out
the native vintage.</p>

<p>On leaving Avenay we ascended the hills to Mutigny, and wound
round thence to Cumières, on the banks of the Marne, finding the
vintage in full operation all throughout the route. The vineyards of
Cumières&mdash;classed as a second cru&mdash;yield a wine which, though celebrated
in the verses of Eustache Deschamps, a famous and prolific Champenois
poet of the fourteenth century, varies to-day considerably in quality,
the best coming from the &lsquo;Côtes-à-bras,&rsquo; the property of the Abbey of
Hautvillers in Dom Perignon&rsquo;s day. The Cumières vineyards join those of Hautvillers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
on the one side and Damery on the other, the latter a cosy
little river-side village, where the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon Roi Henri</i> sought relaxation
from the turmoils of war in the society of the fair Anne du Pay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sa
belle hôtesse</i>, as the gallant Béarnais was wont to style her. Damery
also claims to be the birthplace of Adrienne Lecouvreur, the celebrated
actress of the Regency, and mistress of the Maréchal de Saxe, who coaxed
her out of her 30,000&thinsp;<i>l.</i> of savings to enable him to prosecute his suit
with the obese Anna Iwanowna, niece of Peter the Great, which, had he
only been successful, would have secured the future hero of Fontenoy
the coveted dukedom of Courland. From Cumières can be distinguished
far away on the horizon the ruined tower of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourg</i> of Châtillon,
the birthplace of Pope Urban II., preacher of the first Crusade, and a
devotee of the wine of Ay.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>It was during the budding spring-time when we made our formal pilgrimage
to Hautvillers across the swollen waters of the Marne at Epernay. Our
way lay for a time along a straight level poplar-bordered road, with
verdant meadows on either hand; then diverged sharply to the left,
and we commenced ascending the vine-clad hills, on a narrow plateau
of which the church and abbey remains are picturesquely perched. The
closely-planted vines extend along the undulating slopes to the summit
of the plateau, and wooded heights rise up beyond, affording shelter
from the bleak winds that sweep over here from the north. Spite of the
reputation which the wine of Hautvillers enjoyed a couple of centuries
ago, and its association with the origin of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i>, the
vineyards to-day appear to have been relegated to the rank of a second
cru, their produce ordinarily commanding less than two-thirds of the
price obtained for the Ay and Verzenay growths.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>The church of Hautvillers and the remains of the abbey are situated at
the farther extremity of the village, at the end of its one long street,
named, pertinently enough, the Rue de Bacchus. Time, the iconoclasts
of the great Revolution, and the quieter, yet far more destructive,
labours of the Bande Noire, have spared but little of the royal abbey
of St. Peter, where Dom Perignon lighted upon his happy discovery of
the effervescent quality of Champagne. The quaint old church, scraps of
which date back to the twelfth century, the remnants of the cloisters,
and one of the abbey&rsquo;s ancient gateways, are all that remain to testify
to the grandeur of its past, when it was the proud boast of the
brotherhood that it had given nine archbishops to the see of Reims, and
two-and-twenty abbots to various celebrated monasteries.</p>

<p class="caption">FOUNTAIN AT A CAFÉ IN THE RUE DE BACCHUS, HAUTVILLERS.</p>
</div>

<p>Passing through an unpretentious gateway, we find ourselves in a
spacious courtyard, bounded by buildings somewhat complex in character.
On our right rises the tower of the church with the remains of the
old cloisters, now walled-in and lighted by small square windows, and
propped up by heavy buttresses. To the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
left stands the residence of the
bailiff, and beyond it an eighteenth-century château on the site of the
abbot&rsquo;s house. Formerly the abbey precincts were bounded on this side
by a picturesque gateway-tower leading to the vineyards, and known as
the &lsquo;Porte des Pressoirs,&rsquo; from its contiguity to the winepresses. The
court is enclosed on its remaining sides by huge barn-like buildings,
stables, and cart-sheds; while roaming about are numerous live stock,
indicating that what remains of the once-famous royal abbey of St. Peter
has degenerated into an ordinary farm. To-day the abbey buildings and
certain of its lands are the property of M. Paul Chandon de Brialles,
of the firm of Moët &amp; Chandon, the great Champagne manufacturers of
Epernay, who maintains them as a farm, keeping some six-and-thirty cows
there, with the object of securing the necessary manure for the numerous
vineyards which the firm own hereabouts.</p>

<p>The dilapidated cloisters, littered with old casks, farm implements,
and the like, preserve ample traces of their former architectural
character, changed as they are since the days when the sandalled feet
of the worthy cellarer resounded through the echoing arches as he paced
to and fro, meditating upon coming vintages and future marryings of
wines. Vine-leaves and bunches of grapes decorate some of the more
ancient columns inside the church, and grotesque mediæval monsters,
such as monkish architects habitually delighted in, entwine themselves
around the capitals of others. The stalls of the choir are elaborately
carved with cherubs&rsquo; heads, medallions and figures of saints, cupids
supporting shields, and free and graceful arabesques of the epoch of
the Renaissance. In the chancel, close by the altar-steps, are a couple
of black-marble slabs, with Latin inscriptions of dubious orthography,
the one to Johannes Royer, who died in 1527, and the other, which has
been already cited in detail, setting forth the virtues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and merits of
Dom Petrus Perignon, the discoverer of the effervescing qualities of
Champagne. In the central aisle a similar slab marks the resting-place
of Dom Thedoricus Ruynart&mdash;obit 1709&mdash;an ancestor of the Reims Ruinarts;
and little square stones interspersed among the tiles with which the
side aisles of the church are paved record the deaths of other members
of the Benedictine brotherhood during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. Several large pictures grace the walls of the church, the
most interesting one representing St. Nivard, Bishop of Reims, and his
friend, St. Berchier, designating to some mediæval architect the site
which the contemplated Abbey of St. Peter is to occupy, as set forth in
the legend already related.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the abbey farm, Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon have
erected a tower, whence a splendid view, extending over the vineyards of
Cumières, Hautvillers, Dizy, and Ay, with those lying on the opposite
bank of the river, is to be obtained. Gazing from here, it is easy to
imagine the scene presented in the days when the Abbey of St. Peter
still reared its stately walls, when Louis Chaumejan de Tourille wore
the abbatial insignia, and Dom Perignon displayed with equal pride as
the badge of his office the key of the abbey cellars. Over these slopes
on a dewy autumn morning the latter&rsquo;s eyes, ere sealed in blindness,
must have often wandered, and an unctuous chuckle must have welled up
from between his lips as he marked the grapes steadily advancing towards
maturity. We can fancy him pausing from time to time</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>although in those halcyon days there was neither oïdium nor phylloxera
to be dreaded, and an extra taper or so to St. Vincent, the patron of
vine-dressers, sufficed to secure the crop from ordinary accidents of
flood and field.</p>

<p>When the epoch of the vintage arrived, and the slopes were all alive
with bands of vintagers engaged in stripping the ripened purple bunches
from the vines, and carefully transporting them to the winepress, one
can picture Dom Perignon smiling contentedly at the report of the
gray-haired bailiff that no such crop had been garnered for years
before. And when the must began to gush forth as the stalwart bare-armed
peasants tugged at the levers of the huge press on which M. de Tourille
had placed the glorifying inscription elsewhere cited, with what
satisfaction must Perignon have recognised a foreshadowing of that
divine aroma which lends so exquisite a charm to the choice vintages of
the Champagne! Later on we can imagine him entering the abbey cellar,
stored with the results of his careful labours, as a</p>

<p>The vineyards of the Côte d&rsquo;Epernay, on the southern bank of the Marne,
extend eastward from beyond Boursault, on whose wooded height stands the
fine château built by Madame Clicquot, and in which her granddaughter,
the Comtesse de Mortemart, to-day resides. They then follow the course
of the river, and, after winding round behind Epernay, diverge towards
the south-west.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Amongst them are the slopes of Pierry, Mardeuil,
Moussy, Vinay, Ablois, and Chouilly, the last named situate somewhat
apart from the rest to the east of Epernay, and yielding a light wine,
qualified as slightly purgative. The vines of the Côte d&rsquo;Epernay produce
only black grapes, and many of the vineyards are of great antiquity, the
one known as the Closet, near Epernay, having been bequeathed under that
name by a canon of Laon named Parchasius to the neighbouring Abbey of
St. Martin six and a half centuries ago.</p>

<p class="caption">THE VILLAGE OF PIERRY.</p>
</div>

<p>A short drive along the high-road leading from Epernay to Orleans brings
us to the village of Pierry, cosily nestling amongst groves of poplars
in the valley of the Cubry, with some half-score of châteaux of the last
century, belonging to well-to-do wine-growers of the neighbourhood,
screened from the road by umbrageous gardens. Vines mount the slopes
that rise around, the higher summits being crowned with forest, while
here and there some pleasant village shelters itself under the brow
of a lofty hill. Near Pierry many cellars have been excavated in the
chalky soil, to the flints so prevalent in which the village is said
to owe its name. The entrances to these cellars are closed by iron
gateways, and on the skirts of the vineyards we come upon whole rows
of them picturesquely overgrown with ivy, and suggestive in appearance
of catacombs. Early in the last century the wine vintaged here in the
Clos St. Pierre, belonging to an abbey of this name at Châlons, acquired
a high reputation through the care bestowed upon it by Brother Jean
Oudart, whose renown almost rivalled that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of Dom Perignon himself; and
to-day the Pierry vineyards, producing exclusively black grapes, hold a

midst of huge rocks in the forest of Epernay, rushes down the hills,
and then changes its name to the Cubry, we soon reach Moussy, where
vineyards have been in existence for something like eight centuries;
for we find enumerated in the list of bequests made to the hospital of
St. Mary at Reims in the eleventh and twelfth centuries sundry &lsquo;vineas
in Moiseio&rsquo; devised by such long-forgotten notabilities as Pontius,
priest and canon, Tebaldus Papilenticus, Johannes de Germania, and
Macela, wife of Pepinus. Spite, however, of their long pedigree and
advantageous southern aspect, the Moussy vineyards rank to-day merely
as a second cru. Continuing to skirt the vine-clad slopes we come to
Vinay, noted for an ancient grotto<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>&mdash;the former comfortless abode
of some rheumatic anchorite&mdash;and a pretended miraculous spring to
which fever-stricken pilgrims to-day credulously resort. The water may
possibly merit its renown; but the wine here produced is very inferior,
due no doubt to the class of vines, the meunier being the leading
variety cultivated. At Ablois St. Martin, once a fief of Mary Queen
of Scots, and picturesquely perched partway up a slope in the midst
of hills covered with vines and crowned with forest trees, the Côte
d&rsquo;Epernay ends, and the produce becomes of a choicer character.</p>

<p>As the Côte d&rsquo;Avize lies to the south-east, to reach it we have to
retrace our steps to Pierry, and follow the road which there branches
off, leaving on our right hand the vineyards of Chavot, Monthelon, and
Grauves, now of no particular note, although of undoubted antiquity,
Blanche of Castille, Countess of Champagne, having endowed the Abbey of
Argensolles, on its foundation in 1224, with sundry strips of vineland,
including one at Grauves, possibly the vineyard of Les Roualles, which
yields a wine not unlike certain growths of the Mountain of Reims.
After passing through Cuis, where the slopes, planted with both black
and white varieties of vines, are extremely abrupt, and where Simon la
Bole, man-at-arms of Epernay, and his wife Basile gave, in 1210, &lsquo;four
hogsheads of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vinage</i> to be taken annually&rsquo; to Hugo, Abbot of St. Martin
at Epernay, we eventually reach Cramant, one of the grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premiers
crus</i> of the Champagne. From the vineyards around this picturesque
little village, and extending along the somewhat precipitous Côte de
Saran&mdash;a prominent object, on which is M. Moët&rsquo;s handsome château&mdash;there
is vintaged a wine from white grapes, especially remarkable for
lightness and delicacy and the richness of its bouquet, and an admixture
of which is essential to every first-class Champagne <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i>.</p>

<p>From Cramant the road runs direct to Avize, a large thriving village,
lying at the foot of vineyard slopes, where numerous Champagne firms
have established themselves. Its prosperity dates from the commencement
of the last century (1715), when the Count de Lhery, its feudal lord,
cleared away the remains of its ancient ramparts, filled up the moat,
and planted the ground with vines, the produce of which proved admirably
suited for the sparkling wines then coming into vogue. Prior to this
the Avize wine, made almost entirely from white grapes, fetched only
from 25 to 30 francs the queue; but being found well adapted for the
manufacture of the strongly-effervescent wine known as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saute-bouchon</i>,
it soon commanded as much as 300 francs, and the arpent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of vineyard
rose in value from 250 to 2000 francs.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> To-day the light delicate
wine of Avize is classed, like that of Cramant, as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier cru</i>, and
it is the same with the wine of Oger,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> lying a little to the south,
while the neighbouring growths of Le Mesnil hold a slightly inferior
rank. The latter village and its gray Gothic church lie under the hill
in the midst of vines that almost climb the forest-crowned summit. The
stony soil hereabouts is said to be better adapted to the cultivation of
white than of black grapes; besides which, the wines of Le Mesnil are
remarkable for their effervescent properties.</p>

<p>Vertus forms the southern limit of the Côte d&rsquo;Avize, and the vineyard
slopes subsiding at their base into a broad expanse of fertile fields,
and crested as usual with dense forest, rise up behind the picturesque
old town, which is mentioned in a letter of the Emperor Louis and a
charter of Charles the Bald in the ninth century. It was once strongly
fortified, though a dilapidated gateway is all that to-day remains
of the ancient ramparts, which failed to secure it in 1380, when the
English, under the &lsquo;Comte de Bouquingouan,&rsquo; presumably Buckingham, burnt
the whole of the town except the Abbey of St. Martin, and elicited from
the native poet, Eustache Deschamps, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dit</i> Morel, &lsquo;huissier d&rsquo;armes&rsquo; to
Charles VI. and castellan of Fismes, a lamentation, wherein he fails not
to mention the high renown of the local vintage.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>Vertus can still boast a curious old church of the eleventh century,
with solid Romanesque towers, elaborate mouldings, and richly ornamented
capitals; also a picturesque promenade, shaded with centenarian trees,
together with several quaint old houses, including one with a florid
Gothic window surrounded by a border of grapes and vine-leaves, and
another with a quaintly projecting corner turret, dominated by a conical
roof. The Vertus vineyards are mentioned in a charter of the Abbey of
Ste. Marie, dated 1151. They were originally planted with vines from
Beaune in Burgundy, and in the fourteenth century yielded a red wine
held in high repute, of pleasant flavour, and rich in perfume,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
but which would appear to have been imbued with those purgative
properties<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> traceable in other growths of the Champagne. The red
wine of Vertus formed the favourite beverage of William III. of England,
and was long in high repute. To-day, however, the growers find it more
profitable to make white instead of red wine from their crops of black
grapes, the former commanding a good price for conversion into <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
mousseux</i>, from being in the opinion of some manufacturers especially
valuable for binding a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i> together. The Vertus growths rank among
the second-class Champagne crus.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> vineyards of the Mountain of Reims may be divided into two zones,
one of which, known as the Basse Montagne, is situate north-west
of Reims, and comprises the vineyards of St. Thierry, Marsilly,
Hermonville, and others; whilst the more important zone lies to the
south of the old cathedral city, and includes the better-known crus
of Sillery, Verzy, Verzenay, Mailly, Ludes, Chigny, and Rilly. The
vinelands of Bouzy and Ambonnay are also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
reckoned within it, though
situate somewhat apart on a southern slope of the Mountain some few
miles from the Marne.</p>

<p>The smallest of the Champagne vineyards are those of Sillery, and yet
no wine of the Marne enjoys a greater renown, due originally to the
intelligence and energy of the family of the Brularts, Marquises of
Sillery and Puisieux, to whom the estate originally belonged, and who
seem to have devoted great attention to viticulture from certainly the
middle of the seventeenth century. The reputation of the still wine of
Sillery, &lsquo;the highest manifestation of the divinity of Bacchus in all
France,&rsquo; was firmly established at this epoch. &lsquo;As to M. de Puyzieux,&rsquo;
writes St. Evremond to his friend Lord Galloway in August 1701, &lsquo;he
acts wisely to fall in with the bad taste now in fashion concerning
Champagne in order to sell his own the better;&rsquo; but at the same time
he counsels his correspondent to get the marquis to make him &lsquo;a little
barrel after the fashion in which it was made forty years before, prior
to the existing depravation of taste.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> The marquis here referred to
was Roger Brulart, Governor of Epernay, who was himself a joyous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon
vivant</i>, and died from over-indulgence in the good things provided at
a dinner given by the Chartreux in 1719.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> He was succeeded by his
nephew, Louis Philogène Brulart, Marquis de Sillery et de Puisieux, to
whom, in 1727, on the occasion of his marriage with Mademoiselle de
Souvré, granddaughter of Louvois, the Sieurs Quatresous and Chertemps
presented at his château of Sillery, on behalf of the town of Epernay, a
basket of one hundred flasks of wine.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> He died in 1771, leaving an
only daughter, Adelaïde Félicité Brulart de Sillery, married, in 1744,
to Louis César le Tellier, Maréchal Duc d&rsquo;Estrées.</p>

<p>The wine attained its apogee under the fostering care of the Maréchale
d&rsquo;Estrées, to whom not only this cru, but those of Mailly, Verzy, and
Verzenay belonged, and who concentrated their joint produce in the
capacious cellars of her château, afterwards sending it forth with her
own guarantee, under the general name of Sillery, which, like Aaron&rsquo;s
serpent, thus swallowed up the others. The Maréchale&rsquo;s social position
enabled her to secure for her wines the recognition they really merited,
being made with the utmost care and a rare intelligence, shown by the
removal of every unripe, rotten, or imperfect grape from the bunches
before pressing, so that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vin de la Maréchale</i>, as it was styled,
became famous throughout Europe.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> This lady is not to be confounded
with that other Maréchale d&rsquo;Estrées mentioned by St. Simon, noted for
her exquisite and magnificent although rare entertainments, and so
sordid that when her daughter, who was covered with jewels, fell down at
a ball, her first cry was, not like Shylock&rsquo;s, &lsquo;My daughter!&rsquo; but &lsquo;My
diamonds!&rsquo; as, rushing forward, she strove to pick up, not the fallen
dancer, but her scattered gems.</p>

<p>Later owners of the famous Sillery cru did their best to sustain its
reputation, and Arthur Young, who stopped here in 1787, speaks of the
Marquis de Sillery as &lsquo;the greatest wine-farmer in the Champagne,&rsquo;
having on his own hands 180 arpents of vines, and cellar-room for a
couple of hundred pièces of wine.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Among more recent appreciation of
the merits of Sillery sec may be mentioned the Cossacks, who pillaged
the district in 1814, and who, not being able to carry off all the wine
from the cellar of the Count de Valence at Sillery, stove in some thirty
pièces of the best, and set the place afloat.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The drive from Reims to Sillery has nothing attractive about it. A long,
straight, level road bordered by trees intersects a broad tract of open
country, skirted on the right by the Petite Montagne of Reims, with
antiquated villages nestled among the dense woodland. After crossing the
Châlons line of railway&mdash;near where one of the new forts constructed
for the defence of Reims rises up behind the villages and vineyards
of Cernay and Nogent l&rsquo;Abbesse&mdash;the country becomes more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
undulating. Poplars border the broad Marne canal, and a low fringe of foliage marks
the course of the languid river Vesle, on the banks of which is Taissy,
famous in the old days for its wines, great favourites with Sully, and
which almost lured Henri Quatre from his allegiance to the vintages of
Ay and Arbois that he loved so well.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>To the left rises Mont de la Pompelle, where the first Christians of
Reims suffered martyrdom, and where, in 1658, the Spaniards under
Montal, when attempting to ravage the vineyards of the district, were
repulsed with terrible slaughter by the Rémois militia, led on by
Grandpré. A quarter of a century ago the low ground on our right near
Sillery was planted with vines by the late M. Jacquesson, the then owner
of the Sillery estate, and a large Champagne manufacturer at Châlons,
who was anxious to resuscitate the ancient reputation of the domain.
Under the advice of Dr. Guyot, the well-known writer on viticulture, he
planted the vines in deep trenches, which led to the vineyards being
punningly termed Jacquesson&rsquo;s <em>celery</em> beds. To shield the vines from
hailstorms prevalent in the district, and the more dangerous spring
frosts, so fatal to vines planted in low-lying situations, long rolls
of straw-matting were stored close at hand with which to roof them over
when needful. These precautions were scarcely needed, however; the vines
languished through moisture at the roots, and eventually were mostly
rooted up.</p>

<p class="caption">CHÂTEAU DE SILLERY.</p>

<p>After again crossing the railway we pass the trim restored turrets
of the famous château of Sillery, with its gateways, moats, and
drawbridges, flanked by trees and floral <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</i>. It was here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that the stout squire Laurent Pichiet kept watch and ward over the &lsquo;forte
maison de Sillery&rsquo; on behalf of the Archbishop of Reims at the close
of the fourteenth century, that the Maréchale d&rsquo;Estrées carried on her
successful business as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marchande de vins</i>, and that the pragmatic and
pedantic Comtesse de Genlis, governess of the Orleans princes, spent, as
she tells us, the happiest days of her life. The few thriving vineyards
of Sillery cover a gentle eminence which rises out of the plain, and
present on the one side an eastern and on the other a western aspect.
They have fallen somewhat from their high estate since the days when old
Coffin of Beauvais University sang their praises in Latin:</p>

</div>

<p>To-day the Vicomte de Brimont and M. Fortel of Reims, the latter of whom
cultivates some forty acres of vines, yielding ordinarily about 300
hogsheads, are the only wine-growers at Sillery. Before pressing his
grapes&mdash;of course for sparkling wine&mdash;M. Fortel has them thrown into a
trough, at the bottom of which are a couple of grooved cylinders, each
about eight inches in diameter, and revolving in contrary directions,
the effect of which, when set in motion, is to disengage the grapes
partially from their stalks. Grapes and stalks are then placed under
the press, which is on the old cider-press principle, and the must runs
into a reservoir beneath, whence it is pumped into large vats, each
holding from 250 to 500 gallons. Here it remains from six to eight
hours, and is then run off into casks, the spigots of which are merely
laid lightly over the holes, and in the course of twelve days the wine
begins to ferment. It now rests until the end of the year, when it is
drawn off into new casks and delivered to the buyer, invariably one or
other of the great Champagne houses, who willingly pay an exceptionally
high price for it. The second and third pressures of the grapes yield an
inferior wine, and from the husks and stalks <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie</i>, worth about
five shillings a gallon, is distilled.</p>

<p class="caption">THE VINEYARDS OF VERZENAY.</p>

<p>The wine known as Sillery sec is a full, dry, pleasant-flavoured, and
somewhat spirituous amber-coloured wine. Very little of it is made
nowadays, and most that is comes from the adjacent vineyards of Verzenay
and Mailly, and is principally reserved by the growers for their own
consumption. One of these candidly admitted that the old reputation
of the wine had exploded, and that better white Bordeaux and Burgundy
wines were to be obtained for less money. In making dry Sillery, which
locally is esteemed as a valuable tonic, it is essential that the
grapes should be subjected to only slight pressure; while to have it in
perfection it is equally essential that the wine should be kept for ten
years in the wood according to some, and eight years in bottle according
to others, to which circumstance its high price is in all probability
to be attributed. In course of time it forms a deposit, and has the
disadvantage common to all the finer still wines of the Champagne
district of not travelling well.</p>

<p>Beyond Sillery the vineyards of Verzenay unfold themselves, spreading
over the extensive slopes and stretching to the summit of the steep
height to the right, where a windmill or two are perched. Everywhere the
vintagers are busy detaching the grapes with their little hook-shaped
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">serpettes</i>, the women all wearing projecting close-fitting bonnets, as
though needlessly careful of their anything but blonde complexions. Long
carts laden with baskets of grapes block the narrow roads, and donkeys,
duly muzzled, with panniers slung across their backs, toil up and down
the steeper slopes. Half-way up the principal hill, backed by a dense
wood and furrowed with deep trenches, whence soil has been removed for
manuring the vineyards, is the village of Verzenay&mdash;where in the Middle
Ages the Archbishop of Reims had a fief&mdash;overlooking a veritable sea
of vines. Rising up in front of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the old gray cottages, encompassed
by orchards or gardens, are the white walls and long red roofs of the
vendangeoirs belonging to the great Champagne houses&mdash;Moët &amp; Chandon,
Clicquot, G. H. Mumm, Roederer, Deutz &amp; Geldermann, and others&mdash;all
teeming with bustle and excitement, and with the vines almost reaching
to their very doors. Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon have as many as eight
presses in full work, and own no less than 120 acres of vines on the
neighbouring slopes, besides the Clos de Romont&mdash;in the direction of
Sillery, and yielding a wine of the Sillery type&mdash;belonging to M. Raoul
Chandon. Verzenay ranks as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier cru</i>, and for three years in
succession&mdash;1872, 3, and 4&mdash;its wines fetched a higher price than either
those of Ay or Bouzy. In 1873 the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> commanded the exceptionally
large sum of 1050 francs the hogshead of 44 gallons. All the inhabitants
of Verzenay are vine-proprietors, and several million francs are
annually received by them for the produce of their vineyards from the
manufacturers of Champagne. The wine of Verzenay, remarkable for its
body and vinosity, has always been held in high repute,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> which is
apparently more than can be said of the probity of the inhabitants, for,
according to an old Champagne saying, &lsquo;Whenever at Verzenay &ldquo;Stop thief&rdquo;
is cried every one takes to his heels.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Just over the Mountain of Reims is the village of Verzy, the
vine-growers of which distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
themselves in the fifteenth century
by their resistance to the officials sent to levy the &lsquo;aide en gros&rsquo;
of two sols per queue, imposed by Louis XI. on all wine made within a
radius of four miles of Reims. The Verzy vineyards&mdash;ranked to-day as a
second cru&mdash;date at least from the days of the Knights Templars, when
the Commanderie of Reims had &lsquo;two vineyards near the abbey&rsquo; here. They
adjoin those of Verzenay, and are almost exclusively planted with white
grapes, the only instance of the kind to be met with in the district.
In the Clos St. Basse, however&mdash;taking its name from the Abbey of St.
Basle, of which the village was a dependency, and where Edward III. of
England had his head-quarters during the siege of Reims&mdash;black grapes
alone are grown, and its produce is almost on a par with the wines of
Verzenay.</p>

<p>Immediately prior to the Revolution, one-fourth of the inhabitants of
Verzy were landholders, each cultivating about five arpents of vines,
and obtaining therefrom, on an average, twenty poinçons, out of which
the abbey exacted one and three-quarters for &lsquo;droits de dimes et de
banalité de pressoir.&rsquo; Southwards of Verzy are the third-class crus of
Villers-Marmery and Trépail, the former of which was of some repute in
the Middle Ages.</p>

Reims along the ancient Rue du Barbâtre and past the quaint old church
of St. Remi, one of the sights of the Champagne capital, and notable,
among other things, for its magnificent ancient stained-glass windows,
and the handsome modern tomb of the popular Rémois saint. It was here
in the Middle Ages that that piece of priestly mummery, the procession
of the herrings, used to take place at dusk on the Wednesday before
Easter. Preceded by a cross, the canons of the church marched in double
file up the aisles, each trailing a cord after him, with a herring
attached. Every one&rsquo;s object was to tread on the herring in front of
him, and prevent his own herring from being trodden upon by the canon
who followed behind&mdash;a difficult enough proceeding, which, if it did not
edify, certainly afforded much amusement to the lookers-on.</p>

<p>After crossing the canal and the river Vesle, and leaving the gray
antiquated-looking village of Cormontreuil on our left, we traversed a
wide stretch of cultivated country streaked with patches of woodland,
with occasional windmills dotting the distant heights, and villages
nestling among the trees up the mountain-sides and in the quiet hollows.
Soon a few vineyards occupying the lower slopes, and thronged by bands
of vintagers, came in sight, and the country too grew more picturesque.
We passed successively on our right hand Rilly, a former fief of the
Archbishop of Reims, and noted for its capital red wine; then Chigny,
where the Abbot of St. Remi had a vineyard as early as the commencement
of the thirteenth century; and afterwards Ludes,&mdash;all three of them
situated more or less up the mountain, with vines in every direction,
relieved by a dark background of forest-trees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
In the old days, the
Knights Templars of the Commanderie of Reims had the right of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vinage</i>
at Ludes, and exacted their modest &lsquo;pot&rsquo; (about half a gallon) per pièce
on all the wine the village produced. On our left hand is Mailly, the
vineyards of which join those of Verzenay, and, though classed only as a
second cru, yielding a wine noted for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</i> and bouquet, identified
by some as the vintage which was recommended in the ninth century to
Bishop Hincmar of Reims by his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrère</i>, Pardulus of Laon. From the
wooded knolls hereabouts a view is gained of the broad plains of the
Champagne, dotted with white villages and scattered homesteads among the
poplars and the limes, the winding Vesle glittering in the sunlight,
and the dark towers of Notre Dame de Reims, with all their rich Gothic
fretwork, rising majestically above the distant city.</p>

<p>At one vendangeoir we visited, at Mailly, between 350 and 400 pièces of
wine were being made at the rate of some thirty pièces during the long
day of twenty hours, five men being engaged in working the old-fashioned
press, closely resembling a cider-press, and applying its pressure
longitudinally. This ancient press doubtless differs but little from the
one which the chapter of Reims Cathedral possessed at Mailly in 1384. As
soon as the must was expressed it was emptied into large vats, holding
about 450 gallons, and in these it remained for several days before
being drawn off into casks. Of the above thirty pièces, twenty resulting
from the first pressure were of the finest quality, while four produced
by the second pressure were partly reserved to replace what the first
might lose during fermentation, the residue serving for second-class
Champagne. The six pièces which came from the final pressure, after
being mixed with common wine of the district, were converted into
Champagne of an inferior quality.</p>

<p class="caption">THE VINEYARDS OF BOUZY.</p>
</div>

<p>We now crossed the mountain, sighting Ville-en-Selve&mdash;the village in the
wood&mdash;among the distant trees, and eventually reached Louvois, whence
the Grand Monarque&rsquo;s domineering war minister derived his marquisate,
and where his château, a plain but capacious edifice, may still be
seen nestled in a picturesque and fertile valley, and surrounded by
lordly pleasure-grounds. Château and park are to-day the property of
M. Frédéric Chandon, who has bestowed much care on the restoration
of the former. Soon after we left Louvois the vineyards of Bouzy
appeared in sight, with the prosperous-looking little village rising
out of the plain at the foot of the vine-clad slopes stretching to
Ambonnay, and the glittering Marne streaking the hazy distance. The commodious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
new church is said to have been indebted for its spire to
the lucky gainer&mdash;who chanced to be a native of Bouzy&mdash;of the great
gold ingot lottery prize, value 16,000&thinsp;<i>l.</i>, drawn in Paris some years
ago. The Bouzy vineyards occupy a series of gentle inclines, and have
the advantage of a full southern aspect. The soil, which is of the
customary calcareous formation, has a marked ruddy tinge, indicative of
the presence of iron, to which the wine is in some degree indebted for
its distinguishing characteristics&mdash;its delicacy, spirituousness, and
pleasant bouquet. Vintagers were passing slowly in between the vines,
and carts laden with grapes came rolling over the dusty roads. The
mountain which rises behind the vineyards is scored up its sides and
fringed with foliage at its summit, and a small stone bridge crosses the
deep ravine formed by the swift-descending winter torrents.</p>

      title="Vendangeoir of M. Werlé" />

<p class="caption">THE VENDANGEOIR OF M. WERLÉ AT BOUZY.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal vineyard proprietors at Bouzy, which ranks, of course, as
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier cru</i>, are M. Werlé, M. Irroy, and Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon,
the first and last of whom have capacious vendangeoirs here, M. Irroy&rsquo;s
pressing-house being in the neighbouring village of Ambonnay. M. Werlé
possesses at Bouzy from forty to fifty acres of the finest vines,
forming a considerable proportion of the entire vineyard area. At the
Clicquot-Werlé vendangeoir, containing as many as eight presses, about
1000 pièces of wine are made annually. At the time of our visit, grapes
gathered that morning were in course of delivery, the big basketfuls
being measured off in caques&mdash;wooden receptacles holding two-and-twenty
gallons&mdash;while the florid-faced foreman ticked them off with a piece of
chalk on the head of an adjacent cask.</p>

<p>As soon as the contents of some half-hundred or so of these baskets had
been emptied on to the floor of the press, the grapes undetached from
their stalks were smoothed compactly down, and a moderate pressure was
applied to them by turning a huge wheel, which caused the screw of the
press to act&mdash;a gradual squeeze rather than a powerful one, and given
all at once, coaxing out, it was said, the finer qualities of the fruit.
The operation was repeated as many as six times; the yield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
from the three first pressures being reserved for conversion into Champagne,
while the result of the fourth squeeze would be applied to replenishing
the loss, averaging 7&thinsp;&frac12; per cent, sustained by the must during
fermentation. Whatever comes from the fifth pressure is sold to make an
inferior Champagne. The grapes are subsequently well raked about, and
then subjected to a couple of final squeezes, known as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rébêche</i>,
and yielding a sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquette</i>, given to the workmen employed at the
pressoir to drink.</p>

<p>The small quantity of still red Bouzy wine made by M. Werlé at the
same vendangeoir only claims to be regarded as a wine of especial mark
in good years. The grapes, before being placed beneath the press, are
allowed to remain in a vat for as many as eight days. The must undergoes
a long fermentation, and after being drawn off into casks is left
undisturbed for a couple of years. In bottle&mdash;where, by the way, it
invariably deposits a sediment, which is indeed the case with all the
wines of the Champagne, still or sparkling&mdash;it will outlive, we were
told, any Burgundy.</p>

<p>Still red Bouzy has a marked and agreeable bouquet and a most delicate
flavour, is deliciously smooth to the palate, and to all appearances is
as light as a wine of Bordeaux, while in reality it is quite as strong
as Burgundy, to the finer crus of which it bears a slight resemblance.
It was, we learnt, very susceptible to travelling, a mere journey to
Paris being, it was said, sufficient to sicken it, and impart such a
shock to its delicate constitution that it was unlikely to recover from
it. To attain perfection, this wine, which is what the French term a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin vif</i>, penetrating into the remotest corners of the organ of taste,
requires to be kept a couple of years in wood and half a dozen or more
years in bottle.</p>

<p class="caption">THE AMBONNAY VINEYARDS.</p>
</div>

<p>From Bouzy it was only a short distance along the base of the
vine-slopes to Ambonnay, where there are merely two or three hundred
acres of vines, and where we found the vintage almost over. The village
is girt with fir-trees, and surrounded with rising ground fringed either
with solid belts or slender strips of foliage. An occasional windmill
cuts against the horizon, which is bounded here and there by scattered
trees. Inquiring for the largest vine-proprietor, we were directed to an open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
porte-cochère, and on entering the large court encountered
half a dozen labouring men engaged in various farming occupations.
Addressing one whom we took to be the foreman, he referred us to a wiry
little old man, in shirt-sleeves and sabots, absorbed in the refreshing
pursuit of turning over a big heap of rich manure with a fork. He proved
to be M. Oury, the owner of we forget how many acres of vines, and a
remarkably intelligent peasant, considering what dunderheads the French
peasants as a rule are, who had raised himself to the position of a
large vine-proprietor. Doffing his sabots and donning a clean blouse, he
conducted us into his little salon, a freshly-painted apartment about
eight feet square, of which the huge fireplace occupied fully one-third,
and submitted patiently to our catechising.</p>

<p>At Ambonnay, as at Bouzy, they had that year, M. Oury said, only half an
average crop; the caque of grapes had, moreover, sold for exactly the
same price at both places, and the wine had realised about 800 francs
the pièce. Each hectare (2&thinsp;&frac12; acres) of vines had yielded 45 caques of
grapes, weighing some 2&thinsp;&frac34; tons, which produced 6&thinsp;&frac12; pièces, equal to
286 gallons of wine, or at the rate of 110 gallons per acre. Here the
grapes were pressed four times, the yield from the second pressure being
used principally to make good the loss which the first sustained during
its fermentation. As the squeezes given were powerful ones, all the best
qualities of the grapes were by this time extracted, and the yield from
the third and fourth pressures would not command more than eighty francs
the pièce. The vintagers who came from a distance received either a
franc and a half per day and their food, consisting of three meals, or
two francs and a half without food, the children being paid thirty sous.
M. Oury further informed us that every year vineyards came into the
market, and found ready purchasers at from fifteen to twenty thousand
francs the hectare, equal to an average price of 300&thinsp;<i>l.</i> the acre,
which, although Ambonnay is classed merely as a second cru, has since
risen in particular instances to upwards of 600&thinsp;<i>l.</i> per acre. Owing to
the properties being divided into such infinitesimal portions, they were
not always bought up by the large Champagne houses, who objected to be
embarrassed with the cultivation of such tiny plots, preferring rather
to buy the produce from their owners.</p>

<p>There are other vineyards of lesser note in the neighbourhood of
Reims producing very fair wines, which enter more or less into the
composition of Champagne, and almost all of which can boast of a
pedigree extending back at least to the Middle Ages. Noticeable among
these are Ville-Dommange and Sacy, south-west of Reims. At Sacy the
Abbey of St. Remi had a vineyard in 1218; and in the return of church
property made in 1384, the doyen of the Cathedral is credited with
&lsquo;rentes de vin&rsquo; and about six <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jours</i> of vineland here, the Convent of
Clermares at Reims owning a piece of &lsquo;vigne gonesse.&rsquo; North-west of
the city the best-known vineyards are those of Hermonville&mdash;mentioned
likewise at the beginning of the thirteenth century, and in the return
which we have just quoted&mdash;and St. Thierry, where the Black Prince took
up his quarters during the siege of Reims, and where Gerard de la Roche
wrought such havoc amongst the vines in the twelfth century, to the
great indignation of their monkish owners. The still red wine of St.
Thierry, which recalls the growths of the Médoc by its tannin, and those
of the Côte d&rsquo;Or by its vinosity, is to-day almost a thing of the past,
it being found here, as elsewhere, more profitable to press the grapes
for sparkling in preference to still wine.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">G<span class="smaller">OOD</span> Champagne does not rain down from the clouds, or gush out from the
rocks, but is the result of incessant labour, patient skill, minute
precaution, and careful observation. In the first place, the soil
imparts to the natural wine a special quality which it has been found
impossible to imitate in any other quarter of the globe. To the wine
of Ay it lends a flavour of peaches, and to that of Avenay the savour
of strawberries; the vintage of Hautvillers, though somewhat fallen
from its former high estate, is yet marked by an unmistakably nutty
taste; while that of Pierry smacks of the locally-abounding flint, the
well-known <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pierre à fusil</i> flavour. So, on the principle that a little
leaven leavens the whole lump, the produce of grapes grown in the more
favoured vineyards is added in definite proportions, in order to secure
certain special characteristics, as well as to maintain a fixed standard
of excellence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>While it is admitted that climate is not without its influence in
imparting a delicate sweetness and aroma, combined with finesse and
lightness, to the wine, some authorities maintain that to the careful
selection of the vines best suited to the soil and temperature of the
district the excellence of genuine Champagne is mainly to be ascribed.</p>

<p>Four descriptions of vines are chiefly cultivated in the Champagne,
three of them yielding black grapes, and all belonging to the pineau
variety, from which the grand Burgundy wines are produced, and so styled
from the clusters taking the conical form of the pine. The first is the
franc pineau, the plant doré of Ay, with its closely-jointed shoots
and small leaves, producing squat bunches of small round grapes, with
thickish skins of a bluish-black tint, and sweet and refined in flavour.
The next is the plant vert doré, with its leaves of vivid green, more
robust and more productive than the former, but yielding a less generous
wine, and the berries of which, growing in compact pyramidal bunches,
are dark and oval, very thin-skinned, and remarkably sweet and juicy.
The third variety, extensively planted in the vineyards of Verzy and
Verzenay, is the plant gris, or burot, as it is styled in the Côte d&rsquo;Or,
a somewhat delicate vine, whose fruit has a brownish tinge, and yields
a light and perfumed wine. The remaining species is a white grape known
as the épinette, a variety of the pineau blanc, and supposed by some to
be identical with the chardonnet of Burgundy, which yields the famous
wine of Montrachet. It is met with all along the Côte d&rsquo;Avize, notably
at Cramant, the delicate and elegant wine of which ranks immediately
after that of Ay and Verzenay. The épinette is a prolific bearer, and
its round transparent golden berries, which hang in somewhat straggling
clusters amongst its dark-green leaves, are both juicy and sweet. It
ripens, however, much later than either of the black varieties.</p>

      title="Types of the Champagne Vines" />

<p class="caption">TYPES OF THE CHAMPAGNE VINES IN BEARING.</p>
</div>

<p>There are several other species of vines cultivated in the Champagne
vineyards, notably the common meunier, or miller, prevalent in the
valley of Epernay, which bears black grapes, and takes its name from the
young leaves appearing to have been sprinkled with flour. This variety
being more hardy than the franc pineau is replacing the latter on the
lower parts of the slopes, which are the most exposed to frosts&mdash;a
regrettable circumstance, as it impairs the quality of the wine. There
are also the black and white gouais; the meslier, a prolific white
variety yielding a wine of fair quality; the black and white gamais, the
leading grape in the Mâconnais, and chiefly found in some of the Vertus
vineyards; together with the tourlon, the marmot, the cohéras, the plant
doux, and half a score of others.</p>

<p>The land in the Champagne, as in other parts of France, is minutely
subdivided, and it has been estimated that the 40,000 acres of vines are
divided amongst no less than 16,000 proprietors. A few of the principal
Champagne firms are large owners of vineyards; and as the value of the
soil has more than quadrupled within the last thirty years, even the
smallest peasant proprietors have cause for congratulation.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> These
latter cultivate their vineyards themselves; while the larger landowners
employ labourers, termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forains</i> when coming from a distance and
working by the week for their lodging, food, and from 20 to 30 francs
wages, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tâcherons</i> when paid by the job. The last-mentioned class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
usually contract to cultivate and dress an arpent of vines, exclusive of
the vintage, at from 8&thinsp;<i>l.</i> to 12&thinsp;<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p class="caption">MANURING THE NEWLY-PLANTED YOUNG VINES.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Champagne the old rule holds good&mdash;poor soil, rich product, grand
wine in moderate quantity. The soil of the vineyards is chalk, with a
mixture of silica and light clay, combined with a varying proportion of
oxide of iron. Many of the best have a substratum of stones and sand,
and a thin superstratum of vegetable earth. The ruddier the soil, and
consequently the more impregnated with ferruginous earth, the better
suited it is found to the cultivation of black grapes; whilst the gray
or yellowish soils, such as abound in the Côte d&rsquo;Avize, are preferable
for the white varieties.</p>

<p>The vines are almost invariably planted on rising ground, the lower
slopes, which seldom escape the spring frosts, producing the best wines.
The vines are placed very close together, there often being as many
as six within a square yard, and the result is that they reciprocally
impoverish each other. Planting takes place between November and April,
the vine-growers of the River being usually in advance of those of the
Mountain in this operation. Plants two or three years old and raised in
nurseries are usually made use of. These are placed either in holes or
trenches. The roots have a little earth sprinkled over them, to which a
liberal supply of manure or compost is added, and the holes having been
filled up and trodden, the vines are pruned down to a couple of buds
above the ground.</p>

<p class="caption">VINE PREPARED FOR &lsquo;PROVINAGE.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In the course of two or three years they are ready for the operation
of &lsquo;provinage,&rsquo; or layering, a method of multiplication universally
practised in the Champagne. This consists in burying in a trench, from
six to eight inches deep dug on one side of the plant, two or more of
the principal shoots, left when the vine was pruned for this especial
purpose. The whole of the two-years&rsquo;-old wood is thus buried, and the
ends of the shoots of one-year-old, which are left above ground, are cut
down to the second bud. The shoots thus laid underground are dressed
with a light manure, and in course of time take root and form new
vines, which bear during their second year. This operation is performed
simultaneously with the &lsquo;bêchage&rsquo; in the early spring, and is annually
repeated until the vine is five years old, the plants thus being in
a state of continual progression; a system which accounts for the
juvenescent aspect of the Champagne vineyards, where none of the wood of
the vines showing above ground is more than three years old.</p>

</div>

<p>The two principal plans adopted in provining are styled the &lsquo;écart&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;avance.&rsquo; In the first, which is usually followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in newly-planted
vineyards, the two shoots are carried forward to the right and left&mdash;so
as to form the two base points of an equilateral triangle, of which the
point of departure is the summit&mdash;and are maintained in this position
by the aid of wooden or iron pegs. In the &lsquo;provinage à l&rsquo;avance&rsquo; both
shoots are carried forward in the same direction, and sometimes a
variation embodying the two systems is employed.</p>

<p class="caption">PROVINAGE À L&rsquo;AVANCE.</p>
</div>

<p>When the vine has attained its fifth year it is allowed to rest for a
couple of years, and then the provining is resumed, the shoots being
dispersed in any direction throughout the vineyard, so as to fill up
vacancies. The plants remain in this condition henceforward, merely
requiring to be renewed from time to time by judicious provining. For
instance, it is sometimes found necessary to bend one of the shoots
round into a circle, so that its end may issue from the ground at the
point occupied by the parent stock. The system of provinage is sometimes
carried to excess in the Champagne, with a view of increasing the yield
of wine, which suffers, however, in quality. The network of roots, too,
renders the various operations of cultivation difficult and dangerous,
as they are liable to be injured by the short-handled hoe in universal
use among the Champenois vine-dressers.</p>

<p>Viticulturists inclined to make experiments have tried the system of

<p>The first operation of importance carried out during the year in the
vineyards is the &lsquo;taille,&rsquo; or pruning, which takes place in February,
and consists in cutting away the superfluous shoots, simply leaving
one&mdash;or, if it is intended to multiply by provinage, two&mdash;on each
stock. This is followed about March or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
April by the &lsquo;bêchage,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;hoyerie&rsquo;&mdash;that is, the digging round the roots of the vine&mdash;with which
is combined the provinage. A trench being opened, as already noted, and
the vine laid bare to the roots, it is bent down so that, on filling
up the trench with earth and manure, the stock is entirely covered and
only the new wood appears above ground. This new wood is then shortened
back, and the stakes intended for the support of the vines are fixed in
the ground. These stakes are set up in the spring of the year by men
or women, the former of whom force them into the ground by pressing
against them with their chest, which is protected with a shield of wood.
The women use a mallet, or have recourse to a special appliance, in
working which the foot plays the principal part. The latter method is
the least fatiguing, and in some localities is practised by the men.
An expert labourer will set up as many as 5000 stakes in the course of
the day. When of oak these stakes cost sixty francs the thousand; and
as the close system of plantation followed in the Champagne renders the
employment of no less than 24,000 stakes necessary on every acre of
land, the cost per acre of propping up the vines amounts to upwards of
57&thinsp;<i>l.</i>, or more than treble what it is in the Médoc and quadruple what
it is in Burgundy. The stakes last only some fifteen years, and their
renewal forms a serious item in the vine-grower&rsquo;s budget.</p>

<p class="caption">VINES IN AUTUMN AFTER THE VINTAGE.</p>

<p>In May or June, after the vines have been hoed around their roots,
they are secured to the stakes, and their tops are broken off at a
shoot to prevent them from growing above the regulation height, which
is ordinarily from 30 to 33 inches. They are liberally manured with a
kind of compost formed of the loose friable soil termed &lsquo;cendre&rsquo;&mdash;dug
out from the sides of the hills, and of supposed volcanic origin&mdash;mixed
with animal and vegetable refuse. The vines are shortened back while
in flower, and in the course of the summer the ground is hoed a second
and a third time, the object being, first, to destroy the superficial
roots of the vines and force the plants to live solely on their deep
roots; and secondly, to remove all pernicious weeds from round about
them. After the third hoeing, which takes place in the middle of August,
the vines are left to themselves until the period of the vintage,
excepting that some growers remove a portion of the leaves in order
that the grapes may receive the full benefit of the sun, and raise up
those bunches that rest upon the ground. The vintage over, the stakes
supporting the vines are pulled up later in the autumn and stacked in
compact masses, styled &lsquo;moyères,&rsquo; with their ends out of the ground,
or else &lsquo;en chevalet,&rsquo; the vine, which is left curled up in a heap,
remaining undisturbed until the winter, when the earth around it is
loosened. In the month of February following the vine is pruned and
subsequently sunk into the earth, as already described, so as to leave
only the new wood above ground. Owing to the vines being planted so
closely together they naturally starve one another, and numbers of them
perish. Whenever this is the case, or the stems chance to get broken
during the vintage, their places are filled up by provining.</p>

<p>The vignerons of the Champagne regard the numerous stakes which support
the vines as affording some protection against the white frosts of the
spring. To guard against the dreaded effects of these frosts, which
invariably occur between early dawn and sunrise, and the loss arising
from which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
estimated to amount annually to 25 per cent, some of
the cultivators place heaps of hay, fagots, dead leaves, &amp;c., about
twenty yards apart, taking care to keep them moderately damp. When a
frost is feared the heaps on the side of a vineyard whence the wind
blows are set light to, whereupon the dense smoke which rises spreads
horizontally over the vines, producing the same result as an actual
cloud, intercepting the rays of the sun, warming the atmosphere, and
converting the frost into dew. Among other methods adopted to shield the
vines from frosts is the joining of branches of broom together in the
form of a fan, and afterwards fastening them to the end of a pole, which
is placed obliquely in the ground, so that the fan may incline over the
vine and protect it from the sun&rsquo;s rays. A single labourer can plant, it
is said, as many as eight thousand of these fans in the ground during a
long day.</p>

<p class="caption">UNROLLING MATTING FOR ROOFING THE VINES WITH.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Guyot&rsquo;s system of roofing the vines with straw matting, to protect
them alike against frosts and hailstorms, is very generally followed
in low situations in the Champagne, the value of the wine admitting
of so considerable an expense being incurred. This matting, which is
made about a foot and a half in width, and in rolls of great length,
is fastened either with twine or wire to the vine-stakes; and it is
estimated that half a dozen men can fix nearly 11,000 yards of it, or
sufficient to roof over 2&thinsp;&frac12; acres of vines, during an ordinary day.
To carry out the system properly, a double row of tall and short stakes
connected with iron wires has to be provided. The matting can then be
used as a shelter to the young vines in spring, as a south wall to aid
the ripening of the grapes in summer, and as a protection against rain
and autumn frosts.</p>

<p>Owing to the system of cultivation by rejuvenescence, and the constant
replenishing of the soil by well-compounded manures, the Champenois
wine-growers entertain great hopes that their vineyards will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
escape the ravages of the phylloxera vastatrix. They certainly deserve such
an immunity, for, according to Dr. Plonquet of Ay, they are already
the prey of no less than fifteen varieties of insects, which feed upon
the leaves, stalks, roots, or fruit of the vines. One of the most
destructive of these is the eumolpe, gribouri, or écrivain as it is
popularly styled, from the traces it leaves upon the vine-leaves bearing
some resemblance to lines of writing. It is a species of beetle, the
larvæ of which pass the winter amongst the roots of the vine, and in the
spring attack the young leaves and buds, their ravages often proving
fatal to the plant. Then there is the chabot, which has caused great
destruction at Verzy and Verzenay; the attelabe, cunche, or bêche, which
rolls up the leaves of the vine like cigars, and seems to be identical
with the hurebet or urbec of the Middle Ages; and the cochylis, teigne,
or vintage-worm, which develops into a white-and-black butterfly,
producing in the course of the year two generations of larvæ, having the
form of small red caterpillars, one of which attacks the blossoms of
the vine, while the second pierces and destroys the grapes themselves.
The list of foes further comprises the altise, a kind of beetle allied
to the gribouri; the liset or coupe-bourgeon, a tiny worm assailing the
first sprouting shoots; and the hanneton or cockchafer.</p>

<p class="caption">MATTING ARRANGED TO KEEP OFF RAIN OR HAIL.</p>
</div>

<p>The greatest havoc, however, appears to be wrought by the pyrale, a
species of caterpillar, which feeds on the young leaves, flowers, and
shoots until the vine is left completely bare. The larva of this insect,
after passing the winter either in the crevices of the stakes or in the
cracks in the bark of the vine, emerges in the spring, devours leaves,
buds, and shoots indifferently, and eventually becomes transformed into
a small yellow-and-brown butterfly, which deposits its eggs amongst the
bunches of grapes in July. Between 1850 and 1860 the vineyards of Ay
were devastated by the pyrale, which, like the locusts of Scripture,
spared no green thing; and all the efforts made to rid them of this
scourge proved ineffectual until the wet and cold weather of 1860 put
a stop to the insect&rsquo;s ravages.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> More recently it was discovered
that its attacks could be checked by sulphurous acid, or by scalding
the stakes and the vine-stocks with boiling water during the winter.
Nevertheless, it appeared impossible to check its destructiveness at Ay,
where it made its reappearance in 1879, and caused an immense amount of
damage. On this occasion an ingenious gentleman, M. Testulat Gaspar, was
seized with the idea of combating the pyrale by means of the electric
light. His theory was, that on a powerful light being exhibited in a
central position at midnight amongst the vineyards, with a number of
tin reflectors distributed in every direction around, the butterflies,
roused from slumber, would wing their way in myriads towards the latter,
when their flight could be arrested by sheets of muslin stretched
between poles, smeared with honey and baited with a dash of Champagne
liqueur. The theory was put to the test in August 1879, amongst the
vineyards between Dizy and Ay, where the pyrale was committing the
greatest ravages. The light was turned on, and the butterflies rose
&lsquo;in millions;&rsquo; but they failed to flock to the reflectors, and the
honey-smeared muslin proved quite useless to secure the few which came
in contact with it.</p>

<p class="caption">WINE-PRESS IN THE CHAMPAGNE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">W<span class="smaller">HEN</span> the weather has been exceedingly propitious, the vintage in the
Champagne commences as early as the third week in September, and in good
average years the pickers set to work during the first week of October.
If, however, the summer has been an indifferent one, and only an
inferior vintage is looked forward to, it is scarcely before the latter
half of October that the gathering of the grapes is proceeded with.
There is no vintage-ban in the Champagne, as in Burgundy and other parts
of France; but, as a rule, the growers of Ay and of the neighbouring
slopes commence operations a week or more earlier than those of the
Mountain of Reims, whilst around Cramant and Avize, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
white-grape
region, the vintagers usually set to work when in the other districts
they have nearly finished.</p>

<p>The pleasantest season of the year to visit the Champagne is certainly
during the vintage. When this is about to commence, the vintagers&mdash;some
of whom come from Sainte Menehould, forty miles distant, while others
hail from as far as Lorraine&mdash;are summoned at daybreak by beat of drum
in the market-places of the villages adjacent to the vineyards, and then
and there a price is made for the day&rsquo;s labour. This, as we have already
explained, is generally either a franc and a half, with food consisting
of three meals, or two francs and a half, rising on exceptional
occasions to three francs, without food, children being paid a franc and
a half. The rate of wage satisfactorily arranged, the gangs start off to
the vineyards, headed by their overseers.</p>

<p>The picking ordinarily commences with daylight, and the vintagers assert
that the grapes gathered at sunrise always produce the lightest and most
limpid wine. Moreover by plucking the grapes when the early morning sun
is upon them, they are believed to yield a fourth more juice. Later on
in the day, too, spite of all precautions, it is impossible to prevent
some of the detached grapes from partially fermenting, which frequently
suffices to give a slight excess of colour to the must, a thing
especially to be avoided in a high-class Champagne. When the grapes have
to be transported in open baskets for some distance to the press-house,
jolting along the road either in carts or on the backs of mules, and
exposed to the torrid rays of a bright autumnal sun, the juice expressed
from the fruit, however dexterously the latter may be squeezed in the
press, is occasionally of a positive purple tinge, and consequently
useless for conversion into Champagne.</p>

<p>At vintage-time everywhere is bustle and excitement; every one is big
with the business in hand. In these ordinarily quiet little villages
nestling amidst vine clad hollows, or perched half-way up a slope
tinted from base to summit with richly-variegated hues, there is a
perpetual pattering of sabots and a rattling and bumping of wheels over
the roughly-paved streets. The majority of the inhabitants are afoot:
the feeble feminine half, baskets on arm, thread their way with the
juveniles through the rows of vines planted half-way up the mountain,
and all aglow with their autumnal glories of green and purple, crimson
and yellow; while the sturdy masculine portion are mostly passing to and
fro between the press-houses and the wine-shops. Carts piled up with
baskets, or crowded with peasants from a distance on their way to the
vineyards, jostle the low railway-trucks laden with brand-new casks,
and the somewhat rickety cabriolets of the agents of the big Champagne
houses, who are reduced to clinch their final bargain for a hundred or
more pièces of the peerless wine of Ay or Bouzy, Verzy or Verzenay,
beside the reeking wine-press.</p>

</div>

<p>Dotting the steep slopes like a swarm of huge ants are a crowd of men,
women, and children, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
men, in blue blouses or stripped to their
shirt-sleeves, being for the most part engaged in carrying the baskets
to and fro and loading the carts; whilst the women, in closely-fitting
neat white caps, or wearing old-fashioned unbleached straw-bonnets of
the contemned coalscuttle type, resembling the &lsquo;sun-bonnet&rsquo; of the
Midland counties, together with the children, are intent on stripping
the vines of their luscious-looking fruit. They detach the grapes with
scissors or hooked knives, technically termed &lsquo;serpettes,&rsquo; and in some
vineyards proceed to remove all damaged, decayed, or unripe fruit from
the bunches before placing them in the baskets which they carry on their
arms, and the contents of which they empty from time to time into a
larger basket resembling an ass&rsquo;s pannier in shape, numbers of these
being dispersed about the vineyard for the purpose, and invariably in
the shade. When filled the baskets are carried by a couple of men to the
roadside, along which dwarf stones carved with initials, and indicating
the boundaries of the respective properties, are encountered every eight
or ten yards, into such narrow strips are the vineyards divided. Large
carts with railed open sides are continually passing backwards and
forwards to pick these baskets up; and when one has secured its load it
is driven slowly to the neighbouring pressoir, so that the grapes may
not be in the least degree shaken, such is the care observed throughout
every stage of the process of Champagne manufacture. When the vineyard
slopes are very steep&mdash;as, for instance, at Mareuil&mdash;and the paths
do not admit of the approach of carts, mules, equipped with panniers
and duly muzzled, are employed to convey the gathered fruit to the
press-house.</p>

</div>

<p>In many vineyards the grapes are inspected in bulk instead of in detail
before being sent to the wine-press. The hand-baskets, when filled,
are brought to a particular spot, where their contents are minutely
examined by some half-dozen men and women, who pluck off the bruised,
rotten, and unripe berries, and fling them aside into a separate basket.
In other vineyards we came upon parties of girls, congregated round a
wicker sieve perched on the top of a large tub by the roadside, engaged
in sorting the grapes, pruning away the diseased stalks, and picking
off all the doubtful berries. The latter were let fall through the
interstices of the sieve, while the sound fruit was deposited in large
baskets standing beside the sorters, and which, as soon as they were
filled, were conveyed to the pressoir. When the proprietor is of an
economic turn he usually has the refuse grapes pressed for wine for home
consumption. Spite of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
minute examination to which the grapes are
subjected, a sharp eye will frequently discover in the heart of what
looks like a regular and well-grown bunch a grape that is absolutely
rotten, and capable of infecting its companions when the whole are
heaped up together in the wine-press.</p>

<p class="caption">ARRIVAL OF THE GRAPES AT THE PRESS-HOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>Carts laden with grapes are continually arriving at the pressoirs,
discharging their loads and driving off for fresh ones. The piled-up
baskets, marked with the names of the vineyard-owners whose grapes they
contain, are temporarily stored under a shed in a cool place, and are
brought into the pressoir from time to time as required. In the district
of the River the grapes are weighed, while in that of the Mountain they
are measured, before being emptied on to the floor of the press. In some
places the latter is of the old-fashioned type, resembling the ordinary
cider-press; but usually powerful presses of modern invention, worked by
a large fly-wheel requiring four sturdy men to turn it, are employed.
The grapes are spread over the floor of the press in a compact mass, and
in some rare cases are lightly trodden by a couple of men with their
naked feet before being subjected to mechanical pressure, which is again
and again repeated, only the first squeeze giving a high-class wine, and
the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and third a relatively inferior one. After three pressures
the grapes are usually worked about with peels, and subjected to a final
squeeze known as the &lsquo;rébêche,&rsquo; which produces a sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquette</i>,
given to the workmen to drink, but in many instances forming the
habitual, and indeed only, beverage of the economically-inclined peasant
proprietor.</p>

<p>The must filters through a wicker basket into the reservoir beneath,
whence, after remaining a certain time to allow of its ridding itself
of the grosser lees, it is pumped through a gutta-percha tube into the
casks. The wooden stoppers of the bungholes, instead of being fixed
tightly in the apertures, are simply laid over them, and after the
lapse of ten or twelve days fermentation usually commences, and during
its progress the must, which is originally of a pale-pink tint, fades
to a light-straw colour. The wine usually remains undisturbed until
Christmas, when it is drawn off into fresh casks and delivered to the
purchaser.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the Champagne district is that, contrary to the
prevailing practice in the other wine-producing regions of France, where
the owner of even a single acre of vines will crush his grapes himself,
only a limited number of vine-proprietors press their own grapes.
The large Champagne houses, possessing vineyards, always have their
pressoirs in the neighbourhood, and other large vine-proprietors press
the grapes they grow; but the multitude of small cultivators invariably
sell the produce of their vineyards to one or other of the former at a
certain rate, either by weight or else by caque, a measure estimated to
hold sixty kilogrammes (equal to 132 lb. avoirdupois) of grapes. The
price which the fruit fetches varies of course according to the quality
of the vintage and the requirements of the manufacturers; but the
average may be taken at about 80 centimes per kilogramme, equivalent to
rather more than 3&thinsp;&frac12;&thinsp;<i>d.</i> per lb.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>If in the Champagne the picturesque rejoicings immortalised in the
Italian vintage scenes of Léopold Robert are lacking, and if the grapes,
instead of being trodden to the blithe accompaniment of flute and
fiddle, as in some parts of France, are pressed in more quiet fashion,
a pleasant air of jollity nevertheless pervades the district at the
season of the vintage. Every one participates in the interest which
this excites. It influences the takings of all the artificers and all
the tradespeople, and brings grist to the mill of the baker and the
bootmaker, as well as to the café and cabaret. The contending interests
of capital and labour are, moreover, singularly satisfied, the vintagers
being content at getting their two francs and a half a day, and the
men at the pressoirs their three francs and their food; the vineyard
proprietor reaping the return of the time, care, and money expended
upon his patch of vines, and the Champagne manufacturer acquiring raw
material on sufficiently satisfactory terms, the which, when duly
guaranteed by his name and brand, will bring to him both fame and
fortune.</p>

<p>Should the vintage be a scanty one, the plethoric
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commissionnaires-en-vins</i> will wipe their perspiring foreheads with
satisfaction when they have at last secured the full number of hogsheads
they had been instructed to buy&mdash;at a high figure maybe; still this is
no disadvantage to them, as their commission mounts up the higher. And
even the thickest-skulled among the small vine-proprietors, who make
all their calculations on their fingers, see at a glance that, although
the crop may be no more than half an average one, they are gainers,
thanks to the ill-disguised anxiety of the agents to secure all the
wine they require, which has the effect of sending prices up to nearly
double those of ordinary years, and this with only half the work in the
vineyard and at the winepress to be done.</p>

<p>The vintage in the Champagne comes to a close without any of those
festivals which still linger in the department of the Gironde. On
the 22d of January, the fête of St. Vincent, the patron saint of
vine-growers, it is customary, however, for one of the proprietors in
each village to pay for a mass and give a breakfast to his relatives
and friends, at which he presents a bouquet to one of the guests, who,
in his turn, is expected to pay for the mass and give the breakfast
the year following. On the same day the proprietors entertain their
workpeople, who, after having eaten and drunk their fill, wind up the
day with song and dance, leading to no end of innocent philandering
between the sturdy sons of toil and the sunburnt daughters of labour. On
these occasions the famous vintage song is sometimes heard:</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> special characteristic of Champagne is that its manufacture only
commences where that of other wines ordinarily ends. No one would
recognise in the still brut fluid&mdash;which, after being duly racked and
fined, has somewhat the taste and colour of an acrid Rhine wine, with a
more or less pronounced bitter flavour&mdash;that exhilarating essence which
is capable of raising the most depressed spirits, and imparting gaiety
to the dismallest gatherings. Much as Champagne may stand indebted to
Nature, soil, climate, and species of vine, the sparkling fluid has
contracted a far greater debt towards man, to whose incessant labour,
patient skill, and minute precautions it owes that combination of
qualities which causes it to be so highly prized.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we left the newly-expressed must flowing
direct from the press into capacious reservoirs, whence it is drawn
off into large vats, where it clears itself by depositing its mucous
lees, usually within twenty-four hours. It is then transferred to new
or perfectly clean casks, holding some forty gallons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
each, in which
a sulphur match has been previously burnt. These casks are not filled
quite up to the bunghole, which is generally covered with a vine-leaf
kept in its place by a piece of tile. The bulk of the newly-made wine
is left to repose at the vendangeoirs until the commencement of the
following year; still, when the vintage is over, numbers of long narrow
carts laden with casks of newly-expressed must may be seen rolling along
the dusty highways, bound for those towns and villages in the department
of the Marne where the manufacture of Champagne is carried on, and
where the leading firms have their establishments. Chief amongst these
is the cathedral city of Reims, after which comes the rising town of
Epernay, stretching to the very verge of the river; then Ay, nestling
between the vine-clad slopes and the Marne canal, with the neighbouring
village of Mareuil; next Pierry; and finally Avize, in the centre of
the white-grape district southwards of Epernay. Châlons, owing to its
distance from the vineyards, does not usually draw its supply of wine
until the new year.</p>

<p>In the vast celliers of the manufacturers&rsquo; establishments, where a
temperature of about 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit usually prevails,
the wine undergoes its first fermentation, entailing a loss of about
7&thinsp;&frac12; per cent, and lasting from a fortnight to a month, according as
to whether the wine be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mou</i>&mdash;that is, rich in sugar&mdash;or the reverse.
In the former case fermentation naturally lasts much longer than when
the wine is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i> or green. This active fermentation is converted
into latent fermentation by transferring the wine to a cooler cellar,
as it is essential it should retain a certain proportion of its
natural saccharine to insure its future effervescence. The casks have
previously been completely filled, and their bungholes tightly stopped,
a necessary precaution to guard the wine from absorbing oxygen, the
effect of which would be to turn it yellow, and cause it to lose some of
its lightness and perfume. After being racked and fined&mdash;an operation
generally performed about the third week in December&mdash;the produce of
the different vineyards is ready for mixing together in accordance
with the traditional theories of the various manufacturers; and should
the vintage have been an indifferent one, a certain proportion of old
reserved wine of a good year enters into the blend.</p>

<div class="figleft">
   <a id="fig201" name="fig201"></a>
   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig201.png"
      alt="A Basket Full of Bottles" />
</div>

<p>The mixing is usually effected in gigantic vats holding at times as many
as 12,000 gallons each, and having fan-shaped appliances inside, which,
on being worked by handles, insure a complete amalgamation of the wine.
This process of marrying wine on a gigantic scale is technically known
as making the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i>. Usually four-fifths of wine obtained from black
grapes, and now of a pale-pink hue, are tempered by one-fifth of the
juice of white ones. It is necessary that the first should comprise a
more or less powerful dash of the finer growths both of the Mountain of
Reims and of the River; while, as regards the latter, one or other of
the delicate vintages of the Côte d&rsquo;Avize is essential to the perfect
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i>. The aim is to combine and develop the special qualities of the
respective crus, body and vinosity being secured by the red vintages of
Bouzy and Verzenay, softness and roundness by those of Ay and Dizy, and
lightness, delicacy, and effervescence by the white growths of Avize
and Cramant. The proportions are never absolute, but vary according to
the manufacturer&rsquo;s style of wine and the taste of the countries which
form his principal markets. In the opinion of some clever amalgamators,
a blend comprising one-third of the vintages of Sillery, Verzenay, and
Bouzy, one-third of those of Mareuil, Ay, and Dizy, and the remaining
third composed of the produce of Pierry, Cramant, and Avize, constitutes
the wine of Champagne <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>. Others not less expert declare
that a simple mixture of the Ay, Pierry, and Cramant vintages furnishes
a perfect wine. As when this blending takes place the wine is only
imperfectly fermented and exceedingly crude, the reader may imagine the
delicacy and discrimination of palate requisite to judge of the flavour,
finesse, and bouquet which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i> is likely eventually to develop.</p>

<div class="figright">
   <a id="fig202" name="fig202"></a>
   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig202.jpg"
      alt="Testing the Bottles" />
</div>

<p>These, however, are not the only matters to be considered. There is,
above everything, the effervescence, which depends upon the quantity of
carbonic acid gas the wine already contains, and the further quantity
it is likely to develop, which depends upon the amount of its natural
saccharine. After the bottling, if the gas be present in excess, there
will be a shattering of bottles and a flooding of cellars; while, on
the other hand, if there be a paucity, the corks will refuse to pop,
and the wine to sparkle aright in the glass. The amount of saccharine
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i> has therefore to be accurately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
ascertained by means of
a glucometer; and should it fail to reach the required standard, as is
the case at times when the season has been wet and cold and the vintage
a poor one, the deficiency is made up by the addition of the purest
sugar-candy. If, on the other hand, there be an excess of saccharine,
the only thing to be done is to defer the final blending and bottling of
the wine until the superfluous saccharine matter has been absorbed by
fermentation in the cask.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i> completed, the blended wine, which in its present condition
gives to the uninitiated palate no promise of the exquisite delicacy
and aroma it is destined to develop, is drawn off again into casks for
further treatment. This comprises fining with some gelatinous substance,
usually isinglass, made into a jelly and strained through a &lsquo;tammy;&rsquo;
while, as a precaution against ropiness and other maladies, liquid
tannin, derived from nut-galls, catechu, or grape husks and pips, is
at the same time frequently added to supply the place of the natural
tannin, which has departed from the wine with its reddish hue at the
epoch of its first fermentation. If at the expiration of a month the
wine has not become perfectly clear and limpid, it is racked off the
lees, and the operation of fining is repeated.</p>

<div class="figleft">
   <a id="fig203" name="fig203"></a>
   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig203.jpg"
      alt="Checking the Cleanliness of the Bottles" />
</div>

<p>The operation of bottling the wine next ensues, when the scriptural
advice not to put new wine into old bottles is rigorously followed. For
the tremendous pressure of the gas engendered during the subsequent
fermentation of the wine is such that the bottle becomes weakened, and
can never be safely trusted again.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> It is because of this pressure
that the Champagne bottle is one of the strongest made, as indicated by
its weight, which is almost a couple of pounds. To insure this unusual
strength, it is necessary that the sides should be of equal thickness
and the bottom of a uniform solidity throughout, in order that no
particular expansion may ensue from sudden changes of temperature. The
neck must, moreover, be perfectly round and widen gradually towards
the shoulder. In addition&mdash;and this is of the utmost consequence&mdash;the
inside ought to be perfectly smooth, as a rough interior causes the gas
to make efforts to escape, and thus renders an explosion imminent. The
composition of the glass, too, is not without its importance, as on one
occasion a manufactory established for the production of glass by a new
process turned out Champagne bottles charged with alkaline sulphurets,
and the consequence was that an entire <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i> was ruined by their
use, through the reciprocal action of the wine and these sulphurets.
The acids of the former disengaged hydrosulphuric acid, and instead of
Champagne the result was a new species of mineral water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the bottles used for Champagne come from the factories of
Loivre (which supplies the largest quantity), Folembray, Vauxrot, and
Quiquengrogne, and they cost on the average from 28 to 33 francs the
hundred.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> They are generally tested by a practised hand, who, by
knocking them sharply together, professes to be able to tell, from the
sound that they give, the substance of the glass and its temper, though
occasionally a special machine, subjecting them to hydraulic pressure,
is had recourse to.</p>

<p>The operation of washing, which takes place immediately preceding the
bottling of the wine, is invariably performed by women, who at the
larger establishments accomplish it with the aid of machines, provided
at times with a revolving brush, although small glass beads are
generally used by preference. Each bottle after being washed is minutely
examined, to make certain of its perfect purity, and is then placed neck
downwards in a tall basket to drain.</p>

<div class="figleft">
   <a id="fig205" name="fig205"></a>
   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig205.jpg"
      alt="Transporting the Bottles" />
</div>

<p>With the different Champagne houses the mode of bottling the wine,
which may take place any time between April and August, varies in some
measure, still the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirage</i>, as this operation is called, is ordinarily
effected as follows: The wine, after a preliminary test as to its
fitness for bottling, is emptied from the casks into vats or tuns of
varying capacity in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle du tirage</i>. From these it flows through
pipes into oblong reservoirs, each provided with a row of syphon-taps,
on to which the bottles are slipped, and from which the wine ceases to
flow directly the bottles become filled. Men or lads remove the full
bottles, replacing them by empty ones, while other hands convey them to
the corkers, whose guillotine machines are incessantly in motion. Speed
in the process is of much importance, as during a single day the wine
may undergo a notable change. From the corkers the bottles are passed
on to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agrafeurs</i>, who secure the corks by means of an iron clip
termed an agrafe; and they are afterwards conveyed either to a spacious
room above-ground known as a cellier or to a cool vault underground,
according to the number of atmospheres which the wine may indicate.</p>

<p>With reference to these atmospheres, it should be explained that air
compressed to half its volume acquires twice its ordinary force, and
to a quarter of its volume quadruple this force&mdash;hence the phrase
of two, four, or more atmospheres. The exact degree of pressure is
readily ascertained by means of a manometer, an instrument resembling
a pressure-gauge, with a hollow screw at the base, which is driven
through the cork of the bottle. A pressure of 5&thinsp;&frac34; atmospheres
constitutes what is styled a &lsquo;grand mousseux,&rsquo; and the wine exhibiting
it may be safely conveyed to the coolest subterranean depths, for no
doubt need be entertained as to its future effervescent properties.
Should the pressure, however, scarcely exceed four atmospheres, it is
advisable to keep the wine in a cellier above-ground, that it may more
rapidly acquire the requisite sparkling qualities. If fewer than four
atmospheres are indicated, it would be necessary to pour the wine back
into the casks again, and add a certain amount of cane-sugar to it;
but such an eventuality very rarely happens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
thanks to the scientific
formulas and apparatus, which enable the degree of pressure the wine
will show to be determined beforehand to a nicety. Still mistakes are
sometimes made, and there are instances where charcoal fires have had
to be lighted in the cellars to encourage the latent effervescence to
develop itself.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The bottles are first placed in a horizontal position, the side to be
kept uppermost being indicated by a daub of whitewash, and are stacked
in rows of varying length and depth, one above the other, to about the
height of a man, with narrow laths between them. Thus they will spend
the summer, providing all goes well; but in about three weeks&rsquo; time
the process of gas-making inside the bottles is at its height, and a
period of considerable anxiety to the Champagne manufacturer ensues,
through his dread lest an undue number of them should burst from the
expansion of the carbonic acid gas generated in the wine. The glucometer
notwithstanding, it is impossible to check a certain amount of breakage,
especially when a hot season has caused the grapes, and consequently
the raw wine, to be sweeter than usual. Moreover, when once <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casse</i>
or breakage sets in on a large scale, the temperature of the cellar
is raised by the volume of carbonic acid gas let loose, which is not
without its effect on the remaining bottles. Not only does the increased
temperature unduly accelerate fermentation, but the mere shock of one
bottle exploding often starts such of its neighbours as are predisposed
that way, in addition to the direct havoc wrought by the heavier
fragments of flying glass. The only remedy is the instant removal of the
wine to a lower temperature whenever this is practicable.</p>

<div class="figleft">

   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig207.png"
      alt="Controlling the Fermentation Process" />
</div>

<p>A manufacturer of the pre-scientific days of the last century relates
how one year, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
wine was rich and strong, he only preserved
120 out of 6000 bottles; and it is not long since that 120,000 out of
200,000 were destroyed in the cellars of a well-known Champagne firm.
M. Mauméné, moreover, relates that in 1850 he was called in to consult
about the checking of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casse</i>, which had already reached 96 per
cent.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Over-knowing purchasers affect to select a wine which has
exploded in the largest proportion in the cellars, as being well up to
the mark as regards its effervescence, and are in the habit of making
inquiries as to its performances in this direction.</p>

<div class="figright">
   <a id="fig208" name="fig208"></a>
   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig208.jpg"
      alt="Transporting a Basket Full of Bottles" />
</div>

<p>It is evident that, in spite of the teachings of science, the bursting
of Champagne bottles has not yet been reduced to a minimum, for whereas
in some cellars it averages 7 and 8 per cent, and rises to 15 when the
pressure is unusually strong, in others it rarely exceeds 2&thinsp;&frac12; or 3.
The period between May and September is that in which the greatest
destruction takes place. In the month of October, the first and severest
breakage being over, the newly-bottled wine is definitively stacked in
the cellars in piles from two to half a dozen bottles deep, from six to
seven feet high, and frequently a hundred feet or upwards in length.
Usually the bottles remain in their horizontal position, in which they
gradually develop two essential qualities, that of effervescing well
and that of travelling satisfactorily, for about eighteen or twenty
months, though some firms, who pride themselves upon shipping perfectly
matured wines, leave them thus for double this space of time. During
this period the temperature to which the wine is exposed is, as far
as practicable, carefully regulated; for the risk of breakage, though
greatly diminished, is never entirely at an end.</p>

   <img class="top2 bottom1" src="images/fig210.jpg"
      alt="Champagne Bottles in a Rack" />
</div>

<p>By this time the fermentation is over; but in the interval, commencing
from a few days after the bottling of the wine, a loose dark-brown
sediment has been forming, which has now settled on the lower side of
the bottle, and to get rid of which is a delicate and tedious task. As
the time approaches for preparing the wine for shipment, the bottles
are placed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur pointe</i>, as it is termed&mdash;that is to say, slantingly
in racks with their necks downwards, the inclination being increased
from time to time to one more abrupt.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The object of this change in
their position is to cause the sediment to leave the side of the bottle
where it has gathered. Afterwards it becomes necessary to twist and
turn it and coagulate it, as it were, until it forms a kind of muddy
ball, and eventually to get it well down into the neck of the bottle,
so that it may be finally expelled with a bang when the temporary cork
is removed and the proper one adjusted. To accomplish this the bottles
are sharply turned in one direction every day for at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
a month or six weeks, the time being indefinitely extended until the sediment
shows a disposition to settle near the cork. The younger the wine the
longer the period necessary for the bottles to be shaken, new wine often
requiring as much as three months. Only a thoroughly practised hand can
give the right amount of revolution and the requisite degree of slope;
and in some of the cellars men were pointed out to us who had acquired
such dexterity as to be able at a pinch to shake with their two hands as
many as 50,000 bottles in a single day, whilst 30,000 to 40,000 is by no
means an uncommon performance.</p>

</div>

<p>Some of these men have spent thirty or forty years of their lives
engaged in this perpetual task. Fancy being entombed all alone day after
day in vaults which are invariably dark and gloomy, and often cold and
dank, and being obliged to twist sixty to seventy of these bottles
every minute throughout the day of ten hours! Why, the treadmill and
the crank, with their periodical respites, must be pastime compared to
this maddeningly monotonous occupation, which combines hard labour,
with the wrist, at any rate, with next to solitary confinement. One can
understand these men becoming gloomy and taciturn, and affirming that
they sometimes see devils hovering over the bottle-racks and frantically
shaking the bottles beside them, or else grinning at them as they pursue
their humdrum task. Still it may be taken for granted that the men who
reach this stage are accustomed to drink freely of raw spirits, as an
antidote to the damp to which they are exposed, and merely pay the
penalty of their over-indulgence.</p>

</div>

<p>In former times the bottles used to be placed with their heads downwards
on tables pierced with holes, from which they had to be removed
and agitated. At a still earlier date the process was more or less
successfully accomplished by holding the bottles upside down by the
neck, tapping them at the bottom to detach the sediment, and then, after
shaking them well up, laying them on their sides until the operation was
repeated. In 1818, however, a man named Müller, in the employment of
Madame Clicquot, suggested that the bottles should remain in the tables
whilst being shaken, and further that the holes should be cut obliquely,
so that they might recline at varying angles. His suggestions were
privately adopted by Madame Clicquot; but eventually the improved plan
got wind, and the system which he initiated now prevails throughout the
Champagne.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

</div>

<p>When the bottles have gone through their regular course of shaking, they
are examined before a lighted candle to ascertain whether the deposit
has all fallen on to the cork, and the wine has become perfectly clear.
Sometimes it happens that, twist these men never so wisely, the deposit,
instead of becoming flaky or granular, refuses to stir, and takes the
shape of a bunch of threads technically called a &lsquo;claw,&rsquo; or an adherent
membrane styled a &lsquo;mask.&rsquo; When this is the case an attempt is made to
start it by tapping the part to which it adheres with a piece of iron,
the result being frequently the sudden explosion of the bottle in the
workman&rsquo;s hands. By way of precaution, therefore, the operator protects
his face with a wire mask, or by gigantic wire spectacles, which give to
him a ghoul-like aspect. Frequently it is found impossible to detach the
&lsquo;mask&rsquo; from the side of the bottle, and in this case the only thing that
remains is to pour the wine back again into the cask, with the view of
mixing it in some future <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i>.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>The cellars of the Champagne manufacturers are very varied in character.
The wine that has been grown on the chalky hills is left to develop
itself in vaults burrowed out of the calcareous strata which underlie
the entire district. In excavating these cellars the sides and roofs
are frequently worked smooth and regular as finished masonry. The
larger ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
are composed of a number of spacious and lofty galleries,
sometimes parallel with each other, but often ramifying in various
directions, and evidently constructed on no definite plan. They are
of one, two, and, in rare instances, of three stories, and now and
then consist of a series of parallel galleries communicating with each
other, lined with masonry, and with their stone walls and vaulted roofs
resembling the crypt of some conventual building. Others of ancient
date are less regular in their form, being merely so many narrow,
low, winding corridors, varied, perhaps, by recesses hewn roughly out
of the chalk, and resembling the brigands&rsquo; cave of melodrama; while
a certain number of the larger cellars at Reims are simply abandoned
quarries, the broad and lofty arches of which are suggestive of the nave
and aisles of some Gothic church. In these varied vaults, lighted by
solitary lamps in front of metal reflectors, or by the flickering tallow
candles which we carry in our hands, we pass rows of casks filled with
last year&rsquo;s vintage or reserved wine of former years, and piles after
piles of bottles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> in seemingly endless sequence&mdash;squares,
so to speak, of raw recruits for the historically famous &lsquo;Regiment
de Champagne&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>&mdash;awaiting their turn to be thoroughly drilled and
disciplined. These are varied by bottles reposing neck downwards in
racks at different degrees of inclination, according to the progress
their education has attained. Reports caused by exploding bottles now
and then assail the ear, and as the echo dies away it becomes mingled
with the rush of the escaping wine, cascading down the pile, and finding
its way across the sloping sides of the floor to the narrow gutter in
the centre. The dampness of the floor and the shattered fragments of
glass strewn about show the frequency of this kind of accident.</p>

<p class="caption">DETACHING THE &lsquo;MASK&rsquo; FROM THE SIDES OF THE BOTTLES.</p>
</div>

<p>In these subterranean galleries we frequently come upon parties of
workmen engaged in transforming the perfected <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> into Champagne.
Viewed at a distance while occupied in their monotonous task, they
present in the semi-obscurity a series of picturesque Rembrandt-like
studies. One of the end figures in each group is engaged in the
important process of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgement</i>, which is performed when the
deposit, of which we have already spoken, has satisfactorily settled
in the neck of the bottle. Baskets full of bottles with their necks
downwards are placed beside the operator, who stands before a cask set
on end, and having a large oval opening in front. This nimble-fingered
manipulator seizes a bottle, raises it for a moment before the light
to test the clearness of the wine and the subsidence of the deposit;
holds it horizontally in his left hand, with the neck directed towards
the opening already mentioned; and with a jerk of the steel hook which
he holds in his right hand loosens the agrafe securing the cork.
Bang goes the latter, and with it flies out the sediment and a small
glassful or so of wine, further flow being checked by the workman&rsquo;s
finger, which also serves to remove any sediment yet remaining in the
bottle&rsquo;s neck. Like many other clever tricks, this looks very easy when
adroitly performed, though a novice would probably allow the bottle
to empty itself by the time he discovered that the cork was out. Yet
such is the dexterity acquired by practice that the average amount
of wine, foam, and deposit ejected by this operation does not exceed
one-fourteenth of the contents of the bottle. Occasionally a bottle
bursts in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeur&rsquo;s</i> hand, and his face is sometimes scarred from
such explosions. The sediment removed, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeur</i> slips a temporary
cork into the bottle, or places the latter in a machine provided with
fixed gutta-percha corks and springs for securing the bottles firmly in
their places. The wine is now ready for the important operation of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dosage</i>, upon the nature and amount of which the character of perfected
Champagne, whether it be dry or sweet, light or strong, very much
depends.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Different manufacturers have different recipes for the composition of
this syrup, all more or less complex in character, and varying with
the quality of the wine and the country for which it is intended;
but the genuine liqueur consists of nothing but old wine of the best
quality, to which a certain amount of sugar-candy and perhaps a dash of
the finest cognac spirit has been added.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> The saccharine addition
varies according to the market for which the wine is destined: thus the
high-class English buyer demands a dry Champagne, the Russian a wine
sweet and strong as &lsquo;ladies&rsquo; grog,&rsquo; and the Frenchman and German a sweet
light wine. To the extra-dry Champagnes a modicum dose is added, while
the so-called &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brut</i>&rsquo; wines receive no more than from one to three per
cent of liqueur.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>In establishments wedded to old-fashioned usages the dose is
administered with a tin can or ladle; but more generally an ingenious
machine which regulates the percentage of liqueur to a nicety is
employed. The bottle being usually nearly full when passed to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doseur</i>, he, when a heavy percentage of liqueur has to be administered,
is constrained, under the old system, to pour out some of the wine to
make room for it, and this surplus in many cases is afterwards
transformed into the well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
 <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tisane de Champagne</i>. As soon as the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dosage</i> is accomplished, the bottle is passed to another workman known
as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">égaliseur</i>, who fills it up with pure wine, frequently with a
part of that which has been poured out by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doseur</i>, to the requisite
level for corking. In the event of a pink Champagne being required, the
wine thus added will be red, although manufacturers of questionable
reputation sometimes employ the solution of elderberries, known as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">teinte de Fismes</i>, to impart that once-favourite roseate hue which has
been compared to the glow of fading sunlight on a crystal stream.</p>

<p class="caption">CORKING MACHINE.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">égaliseur</i> in his turn hands the bottle to the corker, who places
it under a machine furnished with a pair of claws (so as to compress the
cork to a size sufficiently small to allow it to enter the neck of the
bottle) and a suspended weight, which in falling drives it home. These
corks, principally obtained from Catalonia and Andalucia, are bound to
possess a close and regular fibre and perfect elasticity. They form
no unimportant item in the Champagne manufacturer&rsquo;s budget, costing
upwards of twopence each, and are delivered in huge sacks resembling
hop-pockets. Previous to being used they are either boiled in wine or
soaked in a solution of tartar, or else they have been steamed by the
cork merchants, in order to prevent their imparting a bad flavour to
the wine, and to hinder any leakage. They are commonly handed warm to
the corker, who dips them into a small vessel of wine before making use
of them. Some firms, however, prepare their corks by subjecting them to
cold-water <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douches</i> a day or two beforehand. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ficeleur</i> receives
the bottle from the corker, and with a twist of the fingers secures
the cork with string, at the same time rounding its hitherto flat top,
at a rate which allows from a thousand to twelve hundred bottles to
pass through his hands in course of the day. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">metteur de fil</i> next
affixes the wire with like celerity;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and then the final operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
is performed by a workman seizing a couple of bottles by the neck and
whirling them round his head, as though engaged in the Indian-club
exercise, in order to secure a perfect amalgamation of the wine and the
liqueur.</p>

      alt="Final Quality Control" />
</div>

<p>The final manipulation accomplished, the agitated course of existence
through which the wine has been passing at last comes to an end, and
the bottles are conveyed to another part of the establishment, where
they repose for several days, or even weeks, in order that the mutual
action of the wine and the liqueur upon each other may be complete. When
the time arrives for despatching them, they are confided to feminine
hands to have their dainty toilettes made, and are tastefully labelled,
and are either capsuled, or else have their corks and necks imbedded
in sealing-wax or swathed in gold or silver foil, whereby they are
rendered presentable at the best-appointed tables. All that now remains
is to wrap them up in coloured tissue-paper, to slip them into straw
envelopes, or encircle them with wisps of straw, and pack them either in
cases or baskets for despatch to all quarters of the civilised globe.</p>

<p>It is thus that Champagne sets out on its beneficial pilgrimage to
promote the spread of mirth and light-heartedness, to drive away dull
care and foment good-fellowship, to comfort the sick and cheer the
sound. Wherever civilisation penetrates, Champagne sooner or later is
sure to follow; and if Queen Victoria&rsquo;s morning drum beats round the
world, its beat is certain to be echoed before the day is over by the
popping of Champagne corks. Nowadays the exhilarating wine graces not
merely princely but middle-class dinner-tables, and is the needful
adjunct at every <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit souper</i>, as well as the stimulant to the wildest
revels in all the gayer capitals of the world. It gives a flush to
beauty at garden-parties and picnics, sustains the energies of the
votaries of Terpsichore until the hour of dawn, and imparts to many a
young gallant the necessary courage to declare his passion. It enlivens
the dullest of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réunions</i>, brings smiles to the lips of the sternest
cynics, softens the most irascible tempers, and loosens the most
taciturn tongues.</p>

<p>The grim Berliner and the gay Viennese both acknowledge the exhilarating influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of the wine. Champagne sparkles in crystal goblets in the
great capital of the North, and the Moslem wipes its creamy foam from
his beard beneath the very shadow of the mosque of St. Sophia; for the
Prophet has only forbidden the use of wine, and of a surety&mdash;Allah be
praised!&mdash;this strangely-sparkling delicious liquor, which gives to the
true believer a foretaste of the joys of Paradise, cannot be wine. At
the diamond-fields of South Africa and the diggings of Australia the
brawny miner who has hit upon a big bit of crystallised carbon, or a
nugget of virgin ore, strolls to the &lsquo;saloon&rsquo; and shouts for Champagne.
The mild Hindoo imbibes it quietly, but approvingly, as he watches the
evolutions of the Nautch girls, and his partiality for the wine has
already enriched the Anglo-Bengalee vocabulary and London slang with the
word &lsquo;simkin.&rsquo; It is transported on camel-backs across the deserts of
Central Asia, and in frail canoes up the mighty Amazon. The two-sworded
Daimio calls for it in the tea-gardens of Yokohama, and the New Yorker,
when not rinsing his stomach by libations of iced water, imbibes it
freely at Delmonico&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Wherever the Romans died they left traces behind them in their quaint
funeral urns; wherever the civilised man of the nineteenth century has
set his foot&mdash;at the base of the Pyramids and at the summit of the
Cordilleras, in the mangrove swamps of Ashantee and the gulches of the
Great Lone Land, in the wilds of the Amoor and on the desert isles
of the Pacific&mdash;he has left traces of his presence in the shape of
the empty bottles that were once full of the sparkling vintage of the
Marne. They are strewn broadcast over the face of the globe, literally
from Indus to the Pole. The crews of the Alert and the Discovery
left them on the ice-bound verge of the paleocrystic sea; the French
expeditionary columns have scattered them within the limits of the
Great Sahara. In the lodges of the red man they are found playing the
part of a great medicine, and in the huts of the negro they assume all
the importance due to a big fetish. Stanley, arriving fainting and
exhausted at the mouth of the Congo, hailed with joy the foil-tipped
flask that the hospitable merchants who answered his appeal for succour
had despatched; and as he quaffed its contents, recalled how he and
Livingstone, when thousands of miles from any other European, had
emptied a bottle of sparkling Champagne together on the night of their
memorable meeting at Ujiji. And when, after the battle of Ulundi, the
victorious British troops occupied Cetewayo&rsquo;s kraal, they found within
the sable potentate&rsquo;s private chamber several empty Champagne bottles,
the contents of which, it is to be presumed, he had quaffed the night
before to the success of his followers. In the Transvaal too, during
the negotiations for an armistice, Sir Evelyn Wood regaled the Boer
delegates with Champagne. On a subsequent occasion, the latter were
unable to return the compliment, excusing themselves by suggestively
remarking, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t take such things with us when we go to fight.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> ancient city of Reims is pleasantly situate in a spacious natural
basin, surrounded by calcareous hills, for the most part planted with
vines. It is fertile in historical associations, rich in archæological
treasures, and at the same time able to claim the respect more readily
accorded in the nineteenth century to a busy and prosperous commercial
centre. Indeed, its historical, archæological, and commercial importance
is in advance of its actual political situation, for administratively
it only ranks as a simple subprefecture in the department of the
Marne. The student of history can hardly afford to neglect a city so
intimately associated with the story of monarchy in France, and one
which has witnessed the coronations of a long series of sovereigns,
beginning with Clovis and ending with Charles X. From the day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
when the &lsquo;proud Sicamber&rsquo; bent his neck at the adjuration of St. Remi, and
vowed to adore that which he had burnt and to burn that which he had
adored, down to the time when the future exile of Holyrood had his
forehead touched by Jean Baptiste Antoine de Latil with the remnant
of the &lsquo;sacred pomatum&rsquo; so miraculously saved from revolutionary
hands, few of the titular rulers of the country have failed to honour
it with their presence. As the Durocortorum of Cæsar, the residence
of Charlemagne, the seat of the great Ecclesiastical Councils of the
twelfth century, the stronghold of the League, and the scene of one of
the first Napoleon&rsquo;s most brilliant feats of arms during the campaign of
1813&ndash;14, it has also earned for itself a conspicuous place in history.
To Englishmen it is, perhaps, most noteworthy as having successfully
checked the victorious advance of the third Edward after Cressy, and
witnessed the apogee of that meteoric career, which began in the
inn-yard at Domremi and ended in the market-place at Rouen, the career
of Jeanne la Pucelle. Nor must it be forgotten that Reims sheltered the
childhood of Mary Stuart, and saw the heralds of England hurl solemn
defiance at Henri II. in the Abbey of St. Remi, at the command of Mary
Tudor.</p>

<p>To the archæologist as to the ordinary sightseer, the chief attractions
presented by Reims consist in its numerous ecclesiastical edifices, some
still serving the purpose for which they were originally erected, others
long since converted to secular usages. Most conspicuous among them is
the cathedral church of Notre Dame, the stately basilica in which the
sovereigns of France were wont to be crowned. This superb monument of
Gothic architecture was commenced in 1210, upon the plans of Robert
de Coucy, by Archbishop Alberic de Humbert. It was completed at the
commencement of the fourteenth century, and though the original design
was somewhat modified&mdash;owing, it is said, to the contributions of the
faithful not coming in with sufficient rapidity&mdash;it remains a marvel
of strength, admirably combined with grace. The exterior is extremely
fine; and the western face, with its elaborately ornate portal, has been
described as &lsquo;one of the most splendid conceptions of the thirteenth
century.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Amidst the almost bewildering multiplicity of ornament,
the triple porch, surmounted by a group representing the Coronation
of the Virgin, the great rose window, flanked by colossal effigies of
David and Goliath, and the range of statues known as the Gallery of
the Kings, running across the façade near its summit, are conspicuous.
The interior, although fine, and containing many objects of interest,
is less impressive, while the plundered treasury can still boast of
many quaint and curious relics of bygone times. But the chief interest
centres in the fact of the surrounding walls having witnessed so many
scenes of stately pomp and pageantry. St. Louis, Philip the Fair, Philip
of Valois, the unfortunate John the Good, Charles the Simple, and
Charles the Victorious, with Joan of Arc, standard in hand, by his side;
the wily Louis XI., Louis the Father of his People, the magnificent
Francis I., and his scarcely less magnificent son, the young husband
of Mary Queen of Scots; the savage Charles IX., Henri III., with his
protest that the crown hurt him, Louis the Just, the Roi Soleil himself,
Louis the Well-Beloved, the hapless Louis Seize, and Charles X., have
all knelt here in turns whilst the crown was placed on their heads, the
sword girded to their sides, and the oriflamme waved above them.</p>

<p>Many of the most famous cities of the Middle Ages are mere fossilised
representatives of former grandeur, but with Reims the case is
otherwise. If somewhat fallen from its former high estate, politically
speaking&mdash;though it should be remembered that Troyes was the titular
capital of the Champagne when the province was ruled by independent
Counts&mdash;its material prosperity has augmented. Round the nucleus of
narrow and often tortuous streets, representing the old archiepiscopal
city&mdash;the &lsquo;Little Rome&rsquo; of the twelfth century&mdash;a network of spacious
thoroughfares and broad boulevards has spread itself, and the life
and movement of a busy manufacturing population are not lacking. In
addition to the wine trade, which of course employs, both directly and
indirectly, a large number of hands, Reims is one of the most important
seats of the woollen manufacture in France, and the industrial element
forms a very important factor amongst its inhabitants. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
addition to the flannels, merinoes, blankets, trouserings, shawls, &amp;c., that
are annually produced, to the value of from thirty to forty million
of francs, there is also a considerable production of gingerbread,
biscuits, and dried pears, enjoying a wide-spread reputation.</p>

<p>The cellars of the great Champagne manufacturers of Reims are scattered
in all directions over the historical old city. They undermine its
narrowest and most insignificant streets, its broad and handsome
boulevards, and on the eastern side extend beyond its more distant
outskirts. In whichever direction we may elect to proceed when
visiting the principal Champagne establishments, our starting-point
will necessarily be the vicinity of the Cathedral, for it is here
that all the hotels are situated. Facing the great western doorway of
the ancient Gothic edifice is the Hôtel Lion d&rsquo;Or, formerly the Hôtel
Petit Moulinet, where the allied sovereigns sojourned on their way to
Paris in 1814, and Napoleon rested on his flight after the battle of
Waterloo. Close by is the Hôtel Maison Rouge, with the commemorative
tablet on its renovated façade setting forth that in the year 1429, at
the coronation of Charles VII. in this hostelry, then named the Striped
Ass, the father and mother of Jeanne Darc were lodged at the expense of
the city council. Almost facing is the newly-erected Grand Hôtel, and
on the north-western side of the Cathedral is the Hôtel de Commerce,
the resort, as its name implies, of most of the commercial travellers
frequenting the capital of the Champagne. The visitor to Reims, be his
object business or pleasure, is bound to put up at one or other of these
four hostelries, and hence the starting-point of his peregrinations is
necessarily the same.</p>

<p>Proceeding along the Rue Tronçon Ducoudray, we reached the Rue de Vesle,
where the Palais de Justice and the new theatre are situated. In the
adjacent Rue du Bourg St. Denis is an old house&mdash;the ground-floor of
which is a wine-shop styled Buvette du Théâtre&mdash;notable for its antique
Gothic doorway, containing, within the upper portion of the arch, the
bas-relief of a man fighting with a bear. There is a tradition that
on this spot formerly stood a hospital dedicated to St. Hubert, and
intended for the reception of persons wounded when hunting, or who
might have chanced to be bitten by mad dogs. In the Rue de Vesle is
another old house with an ornamental frieze surmounting its façade,
which looks on to one of the entrances of the Church of St. Jacques.
This edifice, originally erected at the close of the twelfth century,
is hemmed in on all sides by venerable-looking buildings, while above
them rises its tapering steeple, surmounted by a mediæval weathercock
in the form of an angel. The interior of the church presents a curious
jumble of architectural styles from early Gothic to late Renaissance.
One noteworthy object of art which it contains is a life-size crucifix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
carved by Pierre Jacques, a Remois sculptor of the days of the Good King
Henri, and from an anatomical point of view a perfect <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>.</p>

<p>The Rue de Vesle merges into the Rue des Tapissiers, where in former
times the carpet manufacturers of Reims had their warehouses. In the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the carpets of Reims were as famous
in France as those of Aubusson are to-day, but subsequently they began
to decline. Half-way up this street&mdash;where, by the way, in 1694 the
first numbers of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gazette de France</cite>, the oldest existing French
newspaper, were printed, the news being duly forwarded from Paris&mdash;we
pass the ancient gateway leading to the chapter-court of the Cathedral.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Within the court a weekly market of small wares is now held; but in the
days when the archbishops, dukes, and peers of Reims wielded sovereign
sway in the capital of the Champagne, this open space was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champ
clos</i>, where trials by battle took place. The surrounding buildings
comprised residences for various ecclesiastics connected with the
Cathedral, together with a small farm whence these epicurean priests
derived their supply of fresh milk and fatted capons. According to
ancient custom, the inhabitants of the houses facing the chapter-gateway
were required to keep their doors and windows open on days of religious
processions, the tapers carried by the clergy on these occasions being
of such immoderate length that it was necessary to incline them, and run
them into the doors and windows of the houses opposite when the bearers
passed under the archway.</p>

<p class="caption">GOTHIC HOUSE IN THE MARKET-PLACE, REIMS.</p>

<p>At the end of the Rue des Tapissiers is the handsome Place Royale,
connected with the Place des Marchés by a broad rectangular street
lined with lofty edifices in the modern Parisian style of architecture.
A break ensues in this range of massive-looking buildings as we enter
the ancient Place des Marchés, the forum of Roman Reims, and to-day
bordered more or less by houses of a mediæval character, remarkably
well preserved. Principal among these is a Gothic timber-house of
the fifteenth century, with its projecting upper stories supported
by elaborately-carved corbels, and its entire façade enriched with
mouldings and finials, and with columns and capitals overlaid with
sculptured ornaments.</p>

<p class="caption">STATUE OF LOUIS XIII. ON THE HÔTEL DE VILLE, REIMS.</p>
</div>

<p>Some little distance beyond the Place des Marchés is the Place
de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville, which derives all its interest from the
handsome-looking edifice in the florid Italian style of the early part
of the seventeenth century which gives it its name. The façade of this
building is profusely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
decorated with Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian
columns, and on the pediment above the principal entrance is a
bas-relief equestrian statue of Louis XIII., whom the Latin inscription
beneath fulsomely characterises as &lsquo;the just, the pious, the victorious,
the clement, the beloved of his people, the terror of his enemies, and
the delight of the world,&rsquo; and to whom &lsquo;the senate and inhabitants of
Reims have raised this imperishable trophy.&rsquo; Some century and a half
later, however, the imperishable trophy got hurled down and shattered
into fragments by the populace, and its vacant place was only filled by
the present statue in the year 1818.</p>

<p>To the right of the Place is the Chambre des Notaires of Reims, raised
on the site of the ancient <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">présidial</i>, or court of justice, where the
city magistrates used to be elected during the Middle Ages, and to which
a chapel and a prison were attached. The latter building evidently gave
its name to the adjoining Rue de la Prison, the gloomy-looking houses
of which&mdash;of a more massive character than the gabled structures of
the market-place and the Rue de l&rsquo;Etape&mdash;with their formidably-barred
windows, possible relics of the religious wars, seem to frown, as it
were, upon the passer-by. In a narrow tortuous street leading from this
thoroughfare Messrs. Werlé &amp; Co., the successors of the famous Veuve
Clicquot-Ponsardin, have their offices and cellars, on the site of a
former Commanderie of the Templars; and strangers passing by this quiet
spot would scarcely imagine that under their feet hundreds of busy hands
are incessantly at work, disgorging, dosing, shaking, corking, storing,
wiring, labelling, capsuling, waxing, tinfoiling, and packing hundreds
of thousands of bottles of Champagne destined for all parts of the
civilised world.</p>

<p>The house of Clicquot, established in the year 1798 by the husband of
La Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin, who died in 1866, in her 89th year, was
indebted for much of the celebrity of its wine to the lucky accident of
the Russians occupying Reims in 1814 and 1815, and freely requisitioning
the sweet Champagne stored in the widow&rsquo;s capacious cellars. Madame
Clicquot&rsquo;s wines were slightly known in Russia prior to this date; but
the officers of the invading army, on their return home, proclaimed
their merits throughout the length and breadth of the Muscovite Empire,
and the fortune of the house was made. Madame Clicquot, as every one
knows, amassed enormous wealth, and succeeded in marrying both her
daughter and granddaughter to counts of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien régime</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">HEADS OF PH&OElig;BUS AND BACCHUS.</p>
</div>

<p>The present head of the firm is M. Werlé, who comes of an old Lorraine
family although born in the ancient free imperial town of Wetzlar on
the Lahn, where Goethe lays the scene of his &lsquo;Sorrows of Werther,&rsquo; the
leading incidents of which really occurred there. M. Werlé entered
the establishment which he has done so much to raise to its existing
position so far back as the year 1821. His care and skill, exercised for
nearly two-thirds of a century, have largely contributed to obtain for
the Clicquot brand that high repute which it enjoys to-day all over the
world. M. Werlé, who has long been naturalised in France, was for many
years Mayor of Reims and President of its Chamber of Commerce, as well
as one of the deputies of the Marne to the Corps Législatif. He enjoys
the reputation of being the richest man in Reims, and, like his late
partner, Madame Clicquot, he has also secured brilliant alliances for
his children, his son, M. Alfred Werlé, having married the daughter of
the Duc de Montebello, while his daughter espoused the son of M. Magne,
Minister of Finance under the Second Empire.</p>

<p>Half-way down the narrow Rue du Temple is an ancient gateway, on
which may be traced the half-effaced sculptured heads of Ph&oelig;bus
and Bacchus. Immediately in front is a green <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> forming
the entrance to the Clicquot-Werlé establishment, and conducting to
a spacious trim-kept courtyard, set off with a few trees, with some
extensive stabling and cart-sheds on the left, and on the right hand
the entrance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the cellars. Facing us is an unpretending-looking
edifice, where the firm has its counting-houses, with a little corner
tower surmounted by a characteristic weathercock consisting of a figure
of Bacchus seated astride a cask beneath a vine-branch, and holding
up a bottle in one hand and a goblet in the other. The old Remois
Commanderie of the Knights Templars existed until the epoch of the Great
Revolution, and today a few fragments of the ancient buildings remain
adjacent to the &lsquo;celliers&rsquo; of the establishment, which are reached
through a pair of folding-doors and down a flight of stone steps. The
date of the foundation of this Commanderie is uncertain, but it is
known that a Templar&rsquo;s church occupied a portion of the site in 1170.
In 1311 both the church and the Commanderie passed into possession of
the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, which held them until the epoch of
the Revolution. Formerly the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échevins</i> of Reims used to be elected in
the ancient hall of the Commanderie, which at one period was a sanctuary
for debtors, and also for criminals. Early in the present century the
buildings were sold and demolished.</p>

<p>After being furnished with lighted candles, we set out on our tour of
inspection of the Clicquot-Werlé establishment, entering first of all
the vast cellar of St. Paul, where the thousands of bottles requiring
to be daily shaken are reposing necks downward on the large perforated
tables which crowd the apartment. It is a peculiarity that each of the
Clicquot-Werlé cellars&mdash;forty-five in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
number, and the smallest among
them a vast apartment&mdash;has its special name. In the adjoining cellar
of St. Matthew other bottles are similarly arranged, and here wine in
cask is likewise stored. We pass rows of huge tuns, each holding its
twelve or thirteen hundred gallons of fine reserved wine designed for
blending with more youthful growths; next, are threading our way between
seemingly endless piles of hogsheads filled with later vintages, and
anon are passing smaller casks containing the syrup with which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
préparé</i> is dosed. At intervals we come upon some square opening in the
floor through which bottles of wine are being hauled up from the cellars
beneath in readiness to receive their requisite adornment before being
packed in baskets or cases, according to the country to which they are
destined to be despatched. To Russia the Clicquot Champagne is sent in
cases containing sixty bottles, while the cases for China contain as
many as double that number.</p>

</div>

<p>The ample cellarage which the house possesses has enabled M. Werlé to
make many experiments which firms with less space at their command would
find it difficult to carry out on the same satisfactory scale. Such,
for instance, is the system of racks in which the bottles repose while
the wine undergoes its diurnal shaking. Instead of these racks being,
as is commonly the case, at almost upright angles, they are perfectly
horizontal, which, in M. Werlé&rsquo;s opinion, offers a material advantage,
inasmuch as the bottles are all in readiness for disgorging at the same
time, instead of the lower ones being ready before those above, as is
the case when the ancient system is followed, owing to the uppermost
bottles getting less shaken than the others.</p>

<p>After performing the round of the celliers we descend into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caves</i>,
a complete labyrinth of gloomy underground corridors excavated in the
bed of chalk which underlies the city, and roofed and walled with solid
masonry, more or less blackened by age. In one of these cellars we catch
sight of rows of workpeople engaged in the operation of dosing, corking,
securing, and shaking the bottles of wine which have just left the hands
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeur</i> by the dim light of half-a-dozen tallow-candles. The
latest invention for liqueuring the wine is being employed. Formerly,
to prevent the carbonic acid gas escaping from the bottles while
the process of liqueuring was going on, it was necessary to press a
gutta-percha ball connected with the machine, in order to force the
escaping gas back. The new machine, however, renders this unnecessary,
the gas, by its own power and composition, forcing itself back into the
wine.</p>

<p>In the adjoining cellar of St. Charles are stacks of bottles awaiting
the manipulation of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeur</i>; while in that of St. Ferdinand
men are engaged in examining other bottles before lighted candles, to
make certain that the sediment is thoroughly dislodged, and the wine
perfectly clear before the disgorgement is effected. Here, too, the
corking, wiring, and stringing of the newly-disgorged wine are going
on. Another flight of steps leads to the second tier of cellars, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
moisture trickles down the dank dingy walls, and save the dim
light thrown out by the candles we carried, and by some other far-off
flickering taper, stuck in a cleft stick, to direct the workmen, who
with dexterous turns of their wrists, give a twist to the bottles, all
is darkness. On every side bottles are reposing in various attitudes,
the majority in huge square piles on their sides, others in racks
slightly tilted; others, again, almost standing on their heads, while
some, which through overinflation have come to grief, litter the floor
and crunch beneath our feet. Tablets are hung against each stack of
wine indicating its age, and from time to time a bottle is held up
before the light to show us how the sediment commences to form, or to
explain how it eventually works its way down the neck of the bottle,
and finally settles on the cork. Suddenly we are startled by a loud
report, resembling a pistol-shot, which reverberates through the vaulted
chamber, as a bottle close at hand explodes, dashing out its heavy
bottom as neatly as though it had been cut by a diamond, and dislocating
the necks and pounding-in the sides of its immediate neighbours. The
wine trickles down, and eventually finds its way along the sloping sides
of the slippery floor to the narrow gutter in the centre.</p>

</div>

<p>Ventilating shafts pass from one tier of cellars to the other, enabling
the temperature in a certain measure to be regulated, and thereby
obviate an excess of breakage. M. Werlé estimates that the loss in
this respect during the first eighteen months of a cuvée amounts to 7
per cent, but subsequently is considerably less. In 1862 one Champagne
manufacturer lost as much as 45 per cent of his wine by breakages. The
Clicquot cuvée is made in the cave of St. William, where 120 hogsheads
of wine are hauled up by means of a crane, and discharged into the vat
daily as long as the operation lasts. The tirage, or bottling of the
wine, ordinarily commences in the middle of May, and occupies fully a
month.</p>

<p>M. Werlé&rsquo;s private residence is close to the establishment in the Rue
du Temple, and here he has collected a small gallery of high-class
modern paintings by French and other artists, including Meissonier&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Card-players,&rsquo; Delaroche&rsquo;s &lsquo;Beatrice Cenci on her way to Execution,&rsquo;
Fleury&rsquo;s &lsquo;Charles V. picking up the brush of Titian,&rsquo; various works by
the brothers Scheffer, Knaus&rsquo;s highly-characteristic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i> picture,
&lsquo;His Highness on a Journey,&rsquo; and several fine portraits, among which is
one of Madame Clicquot, painted by Léon Coignet, when she was eighty
years of age, and another of M. Werlé by the same artist, regarded as a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>. Before her father&rsquo;s death Madame Clicquot used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to reside in the Rue de Marc, some short distance from the cellars in which
her whole existence centred, in a handsome Renaissance house, said to
have had some connection with the row of palaces that at one time lined
the neighbouring and then fashionable Rue du Tambour. This, however,
is extremely doubtful. A number of interesting and well-preserved
bas-reliefs decorate one of the façades of the house looking on to the
court. The figures are of the period of François Premier and his son
Henri II., who inaugurated his reign with a comforting edict for the
Protestants, ordaining that blasphemers were to have their tongues
pierced with red-hot irons, and heretics to be burnt alive, and who had
the ill-luck to lose his eye and life through a lance-thrust of the
Comte de Montgomerie, captain of his Scotch guards, whilst jousting
with him at a tournament held in honour of the marriage of his daughter
Isabelle with the gloomy widower of Queen Mary of England, of sanguinary
fame.</p>

<p>The first of these bas-reliefs represents two soldiers of the Swiss
guard, the next a Turk and Slav tilting at each other, and then
comes a scroll entwined round a thistle, and inscribed with this
enigmatical motto: &lsquo;Giane le sur ou rien.&rsquo; In the third bas-relief a
couple of passionate Italians are winding up a gambling dispute with a
hand-to-hand combat, in the course of which table and cards have got
canted over; the fourth presents us with two French knights, armed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pie</i>, engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
in a tourney; while in the fifth and last a couple
of German lansquenets essay their gladiatorial skill with their long
and dangerous weapons. Several years back a tablet was discovered in
one of the cellars of the house, inscribed &lsquo;Ci-gist vénérable religieux
maistre Pierre Derclé, docteur en théologie, jadis prieur de céans.
Priez Dieu pour luy. 1486,&rsquo; which would almost indicate that the house
had originally a religious character, although the warlike spirit of
the bas-reliefs decorating it renders any such supposition with regard
to the existing building untenable. We should mention that the spaces
above the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte cochère</i>, and the window by its side, are occupied
by four medallions, which present that curious mingling of classic
and contemporary styles for which the epoch of the Renaissance was
remarkable.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Werlé own numerous acres of vineyards, comprising the very
finest situations in the well-known districts of Verzenay, Bouzy, Le
Mesnil, and Oger, at all of which places they have vendangeoirs or
pressing-houses of their own. Their establishment at Verzenay contains
seven presses, that at Bouzy eight, at Le Mesnil six, and at Oger two,
in addition to which grapes are pressed under their own supervision at
Ay, Avize, and Cramant, in vendangeoirs belonging to their friends.</p>

<p>Since the death of Madame Clicquot the legal style of the firm has been
&lsquo;Werlé &amp; Co., successors to Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin,&rsquo; the mark, of
which M. Werlé and his son are the sole proprietors, still remaining
&lsquo;Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin,&rsquo; while the corks of the bottles are branded
with the words &lsquo;V. Clicquot-P. Werlé,&rsquo; encircling the figure of a comet.
The style of the wine&mdash;light, delicate, elegant, and fragrant&mdash;is
familiar to all connoisseurs of Champagne. What, however, is not equally
well known is that within the last few years the firm, in obedience
to the prevailing taste, have introduced a perfectly dry wine of
corresponding quality to the richer wine which made the fortune of the
house, and gave enduring fame to the Clicquot brand.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> house of Louis Roederer, originally founded by a plodding German
named Schreider, was content to pursue the sleepy tenor of its way for
some years&mdash;until indeed it suddenly felt prompted to lay siege to
the Muscovite connection of La Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin, and secure a
market for its wine at Moscow and St. Petersburg. It next opened up the
United States, and finally introduced its brand into England. The house
possesses cellars in various parts of Reims, and has its offices in one
of the oldest quarters of the city&mdash;namely, the Rue des Elus, or ancient
Rue des Juifs, where the old synagogue formerly stood, and the records
of which date as far back as 1103.</p>

<p>At the corner of this street, and abutting on the Place des Marchés,
is a curious old house, the overhanging upper stories of which are
supported by huge massive carved brackets, decorated with figures more
or less quaint in design. M. Louis Roederer&rsquo;s offices in the Rue des
Elus are at the farther end of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
courtyard, beyond which is found
a second court, where carts laden with cases of Champagne seem to
indicate that some portion of the shipping business of the house is
here carried on. Several requests made by us for permission to visit M.
Louis Roederer&rsquo;s establishments having been refused, it is only of their
external appearance that we are competent to speak. One of them, in
the Boulevard du Temple, is distinguished by a rather imposing façade,
and has a carved head of Bacchus surmounting its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i>;
while the principal establishment, a picturesque range of buildings of
considerable extent, is situated in the neighbouring Rue de la Justice.</p>

<p>Leading from the Rue des Elus into the Rue de Vesle is a gloomy-looking
ancient street known as the Rue des Deux Anges, all the houses of which
have their windows secured by iron gratings, and their massive doors
thickly studded with huge nails. These prison-like façades, which in
all probability refer to the epoch of the religious wars, succeed each
other in lugubrious monotony along either side of the way; but gain
admittance to their inner courts, and quite a different scene presents
itself. In one notable instance, looking on to a pleasant little
flower-garden, we found a small but charming Renaissance house, with its
windows ornamented with elaborate mouldings, and surmounted by graceful
sculptured heads, while at one corner there rose up a tower with a
sun-dial displayed on its front. In this and in an adjoining house the
canons of the cathedral were accustomed to reside in the days when
something like four-fifths of the city were the property of the Church.</p>

<p>Proceeding along the Rue de Vesle and the neighbouring Rue des
Tapissiers, we find ourselves once more in the Place Royale, the
principal side of which is occupied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the once notable Hôtel des
Fermes, where, in the days of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien régime</i>, the farmers-general
of the Champagne were accustomed to receive the revenues of the
province. A bronze statue rises in the centre of the Place, which from
its Roman costume and martial bearing might be taken for some hero of
antiquity, did not the inscription on the pedestal apprise us that it is
intended for the &lsquo;wise, virtuous, and magnanimous Louis XV.,&rsquo; a misuse
of terms which has caused a Transatlantic Republican to characterise the
monument as a brazen lie. Leading out of the Place Royale is the Rue de
Cérès, in which there is a modernised sixteenth-century house claiming
to be the birthplace, on the 29th August 1619, of Jean Baptiste Colbert,
son of a Reims wool-merchant, and the famous minister who did so much
to consolidate the finances of the State which the royal voluptuary,
masquerading at Reims in Roman garb, afterwards made such dreadful havoc
of.</p>

<p>We again cross the Place des Marchés, at the farther end of which, on
the left-hand side, is the Rue de l&rsquo;Arbalète, notable for a curious
Renaissance gateway, with its pediment supported by two life-size
figures, which the Rémois, for no very sufficient reason, have
popularly christened Adam and Eve. Beyond the Place des Marchés and
the Place de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville, and at no great distance from the
Clicquot-Werlé establishment, is the narrow winding Rue de Sedan,
where the old-established firm of Heidsieck &amp; Co., which has secured a
high-class reputation in both eastern and western hemispheres for its
famous Monopole and Dry Monopole brands, has its central offices. The
original firm dates back to 1785, when France was struggling with those
financial difficulties that a few years later culminated in that great
social upheaving which kept Europe in a state of turmoil for more than
a quarter of a century. Among the archives of the firm is a patent,
bearing the signature of the Minister of the Prussian Royal Household,
appointing Heidsieck &amp; Co. purveyors of Champagne to Frederick William
III. The Champagne-drinking Hohenzollern <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, however,
was the son and successor of the preceding, who, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
habitual over-indulgence in the exhilarating sparkling beverage during the last
few years of his reign, acquired the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</i> of King Clicquot.</p>

<p class="caption">ADAM AND EVE GATEWAY, RUE DE L&rsquo;ARBALÈTE, REIMS.</p>
</div>

<p>On passing through the large <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> giving entrance to
Messrs. Heidsieck&rsquo;s principal establishment, one finds oneself in a
small courtyard, with the surrounding buildings overgrown with ivy and
venerable vines. On the left is a dwelling-house enriched with elaborate
mouldings and cornices, and at the farther end of the court is the
entrance to the cellars, surmounted by a sun-dial bearing the date
1829. The latter, however, is no criterion of the age of the buildings
themselves, as these were occupied by the firm at its foundation,
towards the close of the last century. We are first conducted into an
antiquated-looking low cellier, the roof of which is sustained with
rude timber supports, and here bottles of wine are being labelled and
packed, although this is but a mere adjunct to the adjacent spacious
packing-room, provided with its loading platform and communicating
directly with the public road. At the time of our visit this hall was
gaily decorated with flags and inscriptions, the day before having been
the fête of St. Jean, when the firm entertain the people in their employ
with a banquet and a ball, at which the choicest wine of the house
liberally flows. From the packing-room we descend into the cellars,
which, like all the more ancient vaults in Reims, have been constructed
on no regular plan. Here we thread our way between piles after piles
of bottles, many of which, having passed through the hands of the
disgorger, are awaiting their customary adornment. The lower tier of
cellars is mostly stored with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin sur pointe</i>, and bottles with their
necks downward are encountered in endless monotony along a score or more
of long galleries. The only variation in our lengthened promenade is
when we come upon some solitary workman engaged in his monotonous task
of shaking his 30,000 or 40,000 bottles per diem.</p>

<p>The disgorging at Messrs. Heidsieck&rsquo;s takes place, in accordance with
the good old rule, in the cellars underground, where we noticed large
stocks of wine three and five years old, the former in the first stage
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur pointe</i>, and the latter awaiting shipment. It is a specialty of
the house to ship only matured wine, which is necessarily of a higher
character than the ordinary youthful growths, for a few years have a
wonderful influence in developing the finer qualities of Champagne. At
the time of our visit, in the spring of 1877, when the English market
was being glutted with the crude full-bodied wine of 1874, Messrs.
Heidsieck were continuing to ship wines of 1870 and 1872, beautifully
rounded by keeping, and of fine flavour and great delicacy of perfume.
Of these thoroughly matured wines the firm had fully a year&rsquo;s
consumption on hand.</p>

<p>Messrs. Heidsieck &amp; Co. have a handsome modern establishment in the Rue
Coquebert&mdash;a comparatively new quarter of the city, where Champagne
establishments are the rule&mdash;the courtyard of which, alive with workmen
at the time of our visit, is broad and spacious, while the surrounding
buildings are light and airy, and the cellars lofty, regular, and well
ventilated. In a large cellier here, where the tuns are ranged side by
side between the rows of iron columns supporting the roof, the firm
make their cuvée. Here, too, the bottling of their wine takes place,
and considerable stocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
of high-class reserve wines and more youthful
growths are stored ready for removal when required by the central
establishment. The bulk of Messrs. Heidsieck&rsquo;s reserve wines, however,
repose in the outskirts of Reims, near the Porte Dieu-Lumière, in one of
the numerous abandoned chalk quarries, which of late years the Champagne
manufacturers have discovered are capable of being transformed into
admirable cellars.</p>

<p>In addition to shipping a rich and a dry variety of the Monopole
brand, of which they are sole proprietors, Messrs. Heidsieck export
to this country a rich and a dry Grand Vin Royal. It is, however, to
their famous Monopole wine, and especially to the dry variety, which
must necessarily comprise the finest growths, that the firm owe their
principal celebrity.</p>

<p>Few large manufacturing towns like Reims&mdash;which is one of the most
important of those engaged in the woollen manufacture in France&mdash;can
boast of such fine promenades and such handsome boulevards as the
capital of the Champagne. As the ancient fortifications of the city were
from time to time razed, their site was levelled and generally planted
with trees, so that the older quarters of Reims are almost encircled
by broad and handsome thoroughfares, separating the city, as it were,
from its outlying suburbs. In or close to the broad Boulevard du Temple,
which takes its name from its proximity to the site of the ancient
Commanderie of the Templars, various Champagne manufacturers, including
M. Louis Roederer, M. Ernest Irroy, and M. Charles Heidsieck, have their
establishments; while but a few paces off, in the neighbouring Rue
Coquebert, are the large and handsome premises of Messrs. Krug &amp; Co.</p>

      title="M. Ernest Irroy&rsquo;s Establishment" />

<p class="caption">M. ERNEST IRROY&rsquo;S ESTABLISHMENT AT REIMS.</p>
</div>

<p>The offices of M. Ernest Irroy, who is known in Reims not merely as a
large Champagne grower and shipper, but also as a distinguished amateur
of the fine arts, taking a leading part in originating local exhibitions
and the like, are attached to his private residence, a handsome mansion
flanked by a large and charming garden in the Boulevard du Temple. The
laying out of this sylvan oasis is due to M. Varé, the head gardener
of the city of Paris, who contributed so largely to the picturesque
embellishment of the Bois de Boulogne. M. Irroy&rsquo;s establishment,
which comprises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
a considerable range of buildings grouped around two
courtyards, is immediately adjacent, although its principal entrance is
in the Rue de la Justice. The vast celliers, covering an area of upwards
of 3000 square yards, and either stocked with wine in cask or used for
packing and similar purposes, afford the requisite space for carrying on
a most extensive business. The cellars beneath comprise three stories,
two of which are solidly roofed and lined with masonry, while the
lowermost one is excavated in the chalk. They are admirably constructed
on a symmetrical plan, and their total surface is very little short
of 7000 square yards. Spite of the great depth to which these cellars
descend, they are perfectly dry, the ventilation is good, and their
temperature moreover is remarkably cool, one result of which is that M.
Irroy&rsquo;s loss from breakage never exceeds four per cent per annum. M.
Irroy holds a high position as a vineyard proprietor in the Champagne,
his vines covering an area of nearly ninety acres. At Mareuil and Avenay
he owns some twenty-five acres, at Verzenay and Verzy about fifteen,
and at Ambonnay and Bouzy close upon fifty acres. His father and his
uncle, whose properties he inherited or purchased, commenced some
thirty years ago to plant vines on certain slopes of Bouzy possessing
a southern aspect, and he has followed their example with such success
both at Bouzy and Ambonnay, that the Reims Agricultural Association
in 1873 conferred upon him a silver-gilt medal for his plantations of
vines, and in 1880 presented him with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupe d&rsquo;honneur</i>. M. Irroy owns
vendangeoirs at Verzenay, Avenay, and Ambonnay; and at Bouzy, where
his largest vineyards are, he has built some excellent cottages for
his labourers. He has also constructed a substantial bridge over the
ravine which, formed by winter torrents from the hills, intersects the
principal vineyard slopes of Bouzy.</p>

<p>M. Ernest Irroy&rsquo;s wines, prepared with scrupulous care and rare
intelligence, have been known in England for some years past, and are
steadily increasing in popularity. They are emphatically connoisseurs&rsquo;
wines. The best West-end clubs, such as White&rsquo;s, Arthur&rsquo;s, the old
Carlton, and the like, lay down the cuvées of this house in good years
as they lay down their vintage ports and finer clarets, and drink them,
not in a crude state, but when they are in perfection&mdash;that is, in five
to ten years&rsquo; time. M. Irroy exports to the British colonies and to the
United States the same fine wines which he ships to England.</p>

<p>Several well-known Champagne firms have their establishments in this
quarter of Reims. In addition to those already mentioned, we may
instance G. H. Mumm &amp; Co., who are located in the Rue Andrieux, only
a short distance from the grand triumphal arch known as the Gate of
Mars, by far the most important Roman remain of which the Champagne can
boast. Within a stone&rsquo;s throw of this arch there formerly stood the
ancient château of the Archbishops of Reims, demolished close upon three
centuries ago. In the Rue de Mars, a winding ill-paved thoroughfare
leading from the Gate of Mars to the Place de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville, Jules
Mumm &amp; Co., an offshoot from the once famous firm of P. A. Mumm &amp; Co.,
are installed; while in a massive and somewhat pretentious-looking
house, dating back to the time of Louis Quatorze, in a corner of the
Place de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville, Ruinart Père et Fils, who claim to rank as
the oldest existing Champagne establishment, have their offices. The
late Vicomte de Brimont, the recent head of the firm, was a collateral
descendant of the Dom Ruinart, whose remains repose nigh to those of the
illustrious Dom Perignon in the abbey church of Hautvillers. From the
Place de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville we proceed through the narrow Rue du Tambour,
originally a Roman thoroughfare, and during the Middle Ages the locality
where the nobility of Reims principally had their abodes. Half-way up
this street stands the famous House of the Musicians, one of the most
interesting architectural relics of which the capital of the Champagne
can boast. It evidently dates from the early part of the fourteenth
century, but by whom it was erected is unknown. Some ascribe it to
the Knights Templars, others to the Counts of Champagne, while others
suppose it to have been the residence of the famous Counts de la Marck,
who in later times diverged into three separate branches, the first
furnishing Dukes of Cleves and Jülich to Germany, and Dukes of Nevers
and Counts of Eu to France; while the second became Dukes of Bouillon
and Princes of Sedan, titles which passed to the Turennes when Henri de
la Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, married the surviving heiress
of the house. The third branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
comprised the Barons of Lumain, allied
to the Hohenzollerns. Their most famous member slew Louis de Bourbon,
Archbishop of Liège, and flung his body into the Meuse; and subsequently
became celebrated as the Wild Boar of the Ardennes, of whom all readers
of <cite>Quentin Durward</cite> will retain a lively recollection.</p>

      title="House of the Musicians, Rue du Tambour" />

<p class="caption">THE HOUSE OF THE MUSICIANS IN THE RUE DU TAMBOUR, REIMS.</p>
</div>

<p>To return, however, to the House of the Musicians. A probable conjecture
ascribes the origin of the quaint mediæval structure to the Brotherhood
of Minstrels of Reims, who in the thirteenth century enjoyed a
considerable reputation, not merely in the Champagne, but throughout
the North of France. The house takes its present name from five seated
statues of musicians, larger than life-size, occupying the Gothic niches
between the first-floor windows, and resting upon brackets ornamented
with grotesque heads. It is thought that the partially-damaged figure
on the left-hand side was originally playing a drum and a species of
clarionet. The next one evidently has the remnants of a harp in his
raised hands. The third or central figure is supposed merely to have
held a hawk upon his wrist; whilst the fourth seeks to extract harmony
from a dilapidated bagpipe; and the fifth, with crossed legs, strums
complacently away upon the fiddle. The ground-floor of the quaint old
tenement is to-day an oil and colour shop, the front of which is covered
with chequers in all the tints of the rainbow.</p>

<p>Leading from the Rue du Tambour is the Rue de la Belle Image, thus named
from a handsome statuette of the Virgin, which formerly decorated a
corner niche; and beyond is the Rue St. Hilaire, where Messrs. Barnett
et Fils, trading under the designation of Périnet et Fils, and the
only English house engaged in the manufacture of Champagne, have an
establishment which is certainly as perfect as any to be found in Reims.
Above-ground are several large store-rooms, where vintage-casks and the
various utensils common to a Champagne establishment are kept; and a
capacious cellier, upwards of one hundred and fifty feet in length, with
its roof resting on massive timber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
supports. Here new wine is stored
preparatory to being blended and bottled; and in the huge tun, holding
nearly three thousand gallons, standing at the further end, the firm
make their cuvée; while adjacent is a room where stocks of corks and
labels, metal foil, and the like are kept.</p>

<p class="caption">MESSRS. PÉRINET ET FILS&rsquo; ESTABLISHMENT IN THE RUE ST.
HILAIRE, REIMS.</p>
</div>

<p>Underneath this building there are three stories of cellars&mdash;an
exceedingly rare thing anywhere in the Champagne&mdash;all constructed
in solid masonry on a uniform plan, each story comprising two wide
galleries, running parallel with each other and connected by means of
transverse passages. Spite of the great depth to which these cellars
descend, they are perfectly dry; the ventilation, too, is excellent;
and their different temperatures render them especially suitable for
the storage of Champagne, the temperature of the lowest cellar being 6°
Centigrade (43° Fahrenheit), or one degree Centigrade below the cellar
immediately above, which in its turn is two degrees below the uppermost
of all. The advantage of this is that, when the wine develops an excess
of effervescence, any undue proportion of breakages can be checked by
removing the bottles to a lower cellar, and consequently into a lower
temperature.</p>

<p>The first cellars we enter are closely stacked with wine in bottle,
which is gradually clearing itself by the formation of a deposit; while
in an adjoining cellar on the same level the operations of disgorging,
liqueuring, and corking are going on. At the end of this gallery is a
spacious compartment, where a large stock of <em>pure Champagne</em> cognac
of grand vintages is stored for cask and liqueur use. In the cellars
immediately beneath, bottles of wine repose in solid stacks ready for
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeur</i>; while others rest in racks, in order that they may
undergo their daily shaking. In the lowest cellars reserved wine in cask
is stored, as it best retains its natural freshness and purity in a very
cool place. All air is carefully excluded from the casks; any ullage
is immediately replaced; and, as evaporation is continually going on,
the casks are examined every fortnight, when any deficiency is at once
replenished. At Messrs. Périnet et Fils&rsquo;, as at all the first-class
establishments, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mélange</i> comprising the produce of
some of the best vineyards, and has every possible attention paid to it
during its progressive stages of development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>From the second tier of cellars at Messrs. Périnet et Fils&rsquo; a gallery
extends, under the Rue St. Hilaire, to some extensive vaults excavated
beneath an adjacent building, in which the Reims Military Club is
installed. These vaults, arranged in two separate stories, are eight
in number, and in them we found a quarter of a million bottles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
brut</i>, reposing either in solid stacks or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur pointe</i>, the latter going
through their daily shaking in order to fit them for the operation of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgement</i>. On the whole the cellars of Périnet et Fils, including
the six long galleries already described, suffice for the storage of a
million bottles of Champagne.</p>

<p>Before leaving the establishment Champagnes of different years were
shown to us, all of them soft, light, and delicate, and with that fine
flavour and full perfume which the best growths of the Marne alone
exhibit. Among several curiosities submitted to us was a still Verzenay
of the year 1857, one of the most delicate wines it was ever our fortune
to taste. Light in body, rich in colour, of a singularly novel and
refined flavour, and with a magnificent yet indefinable bouquet, the
wine was in every respect perfect. Not only was the year of the vintage
a grand one, but the wine must have been made with the greatest possible
care, and from the most perfect grapes, for so delicate a growth to have
retained its flavour in such perfection, and preserved its brilliant
ruby colour for such a length of time.</p>

<p>From the samples shown to us of Périnet et Fils&rsquo; Champagne, we were
prepared to find that at some recent tastings in London, the particulars
of which have been made public, their Extra Sec took the first place at
each of the three severe competitions to which it was subjected.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">N<span class="smaller">IGH</span> the cathedral of Reims, and in the rear of the archiepiscopal
palace, there runs a short narrow street known as the Rue Vauthier le
Noir, and frequently mentioned in old works relating to the present
capital of the Champagne. The discovery of various pillars and statues,
together with a handsome Gallo-Roman altar, whilst digging some
foundations in 1837, points to the fact that a Pagan temple formerly
occupied the site. The street is supposed to have taken its name,
however, from some celebrated gaoler, for in mediæval times here stood
&lsquo;la prison de bonne semaine.&rsquo; On the site of this prison a château was
subsequently built, which tradition has erroneously fixed upon as the
residence of the beautiful and luckless Mary Queen of Scots, in the
days when her uncle, Cardinal Charles de Lorraine, was Lord Archbishop
of Reims. Temple, prison, and palace have alike disappeared, and where
they stood there now rises midway between court and garden a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
handsome mansion, the residence of Madame Pommery, head of the well-known firm of
Pommery &amp; Greno. To the left of the courtyard, which is entered through
a monumental gateway, are some old buildings, let into the walls of
which are a couple of sculptured escutcheons, the one comprising the
arms of France, and the other those of the Cardinal de Lorraine. On the
right-hand side of the courtyard are the Pommery offices, together with
the manager&rsquo;s sanctum, replete with artistic curiosities, the walls
being completely covered with remarkable specimens of faïence, including
Rouen, Gien, Palissy, Delft, and majolica, collected in the majority of
instances by Madame Pommery in the villages around Reims. Here we were
received by M. Vasnier, who at once volunteered to accompany us to the
cellars of the firm outside the city. Messrs. Pommery &amp; Greno originally
carried on business in the Rue Vauthier le Noir, where there are
extensive cellars, but their rapidly-increasing connection long since
compelled them to emigrate beyond the walls of Reims.</p>

<p>In close proximity to the Rue Vauthier le Noir is the Rue des Anglais,
so named from the English Catholic refugees, who, flying from the
persecutions of our so-called Good Queen Bess, here took up their abode
and established a college and a seminary. They rapidly acquired great
influence in Reims, and one of their number, William Gifford, was even
elected archbishop. At the end of this street, nigh to Madame Pommery&rsquo;s,
there stands an old house erected late in the fifteenth century, with
a corner tower and rather handsome Renaissance window, which formerly
belonged to some of the clergy of the cathedral, and subsequently became
the &lsquo;Bureau Général de la Loterie de France,&rsquo; an institution abolished
by the National Convention in 1793.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD HOUSE IN THE RUE DES ANGLAIS, REIMS.</p>
</div>

<p>The Rue des Anglais conducts into the Rue de l&rsquo;Université, where a few
remnants of the old University, founded by Cardinal Charles de Lorraine
(1538&ndash;74), formerly attracted attention, notably a conical-capped
corner tower, the sculptured ornaments at the base of which had
crumbled into dust beneath the corroding tooth of Time.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> From the
Rue de l&rsquo;Université our way lies along the Boulevard du Temple to the
Porte Gerbert, about a mile beyond which there rises up the curious
castellated structure in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the Pommery establishment is installed,
with its tall towers commanding a view of the whole of Reims and its
environs. As we drive up the Avenue Gerbert we espy on the right an
isolated crumbling tower, a remnant of the ancient fortifications of
Reims,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> while close at hand, and under the old city-walls, is a
grotto, to which an ancient origin is likewise ascribed. In another
minute we reach the open iron gates of Messrs. Pommery&rsquo;s establishment,
flanked by a picturesque porter&rsquo;s lodge; and proceeding up a broad
drive, we alight under a Gothic portico at the entrance to the spacious
and lofty cellier. Iron girders support the roof of this vast hall, 180
feet in length and 90 feet in width, without the aid of a single column.
At one end is the office and tasting-room, provided with a telegraphic
apparatus and telephone, by means of which communication is carried
on with the Reims bureaux. Stacked up on every side of the cellier,
and often in eight tiers when empty, are rows upon rows of casks, 6000
of which contain wine of the costly vintage of 1880 sufficient for
a million and a half bottles of Champagne. The temperature of this
hall is carefully regulated; the windows are high up near the roof,
and the sun&rsquo;s rays are rigidly excluded, so that a pleasant coolness
pervades the building. On the left-hand side stand two huge tuns, with
the monogram P. and G., surmounting the arms of Reims, carved on their
heads. These are capable of containing 5500 gallons of wine, and in
them the firm make their cuvée. A platform, access to which is gained
by a staircase in a side aisle, runs round one of these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foudres</i>; and
when the wine, which has been hoisted up in casks and poured through a
metal trough into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foudre</i>, is being blended, boys stand on this
platform and, by means of a handle protruding above the cask, work the
paddle-wheels placed inside, thereby securing the complete amalgamation
of the wine. Adjoining are the chains and lifts worked by steam, by
means of which wine is raised and lowered from and to the cellars
beneath, one lift raising or lowering eight casks, whether full or
empty, in the space of a minute.</p>

<p class="caption">THE POMMERY AND GRENO ESTABLISHMENT IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF

</div>

<p>At the farther end of the hall a Gothic door, decorated with ornamental
ironwork, leads to the long broad flight of steps, 116 in number,
and nearly twelve feet in width, conducting to the suite of lofty
subterranean chambers, where bottles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> repose in their
hundreds of thousands in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
slanting racks or solid piles, passing
leisurely through those stages of development necessary to fit them
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeur</i>. Altogether there are 130 large shafts, 90 feet in
depth and 60 feet square at their base, which were originally quarries,
and are now connected by spacious galleries. This side of Reims abounds
with similar chalk quarries, commonly believed to have served as places
of refuge for the Protestants at the time of the League and after the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes; and it is even conjectured that the
early Christians&mdash;the followers of St. Sixtus and St. Sinicus&mdash;here
hid themselves from their persecutors. Since the cellars within the
city have no longer sufficed for the storage of the immense stocks
required through the development of the Champagne trade, these vast
subterranean galleries have been successfully utilised by various
firms. Messrs. Pommery, after filling up the chambers above the water
level, proceeded to excavate the connecting tunnels, shore up the
cracking arches, and repair the flaws in the chalk with masonry, finally
converting these abandoned quarries into magnificent cellars for the
storage of Champagne. No less than 60,000&thinsp;<i>l.</i> was spent upon them and
the castellated structure aboveground. Several millions of bottles of
Champagne can be stored in these capacious vaults, the area of which is
nearly 450,000 square feet.</p>

</div>

<p>Madame Pommery made a great mark with her splendid cuvées of 1868 and
1874, the result being that her brand has become widely popular, and
that it invariably realises exceptionally high prices.</p>

<p>On leaving Messrs. Pommery&rsquo;s we retrace our steps down the Avenue
Gerbert, bordered on either side with rows of plane-trees, until we
reach the treeless Avenue de Sillery, where Messrs. de St. Marceaux &amp;
Co.&rsquo;s new and capacious establishment is installed. Simple and without
pretension, the establishment, which covers an area of upwards of 18,000
feet, is distinguished for its perfect appropriateness to the industry
for which it was designed. The principal block of building is flanked by
two advanced wings enclosing a garden-court, set off with flowers and
shrubs, and from the centre of which rises a circular shaft, covered
in with glass, and admitting light and air to the cellars below. In
the building to the left the wine is received on its arrival from the
vineyard, and here are ranged large quantities of casks replete with
the choice crus of Verzenay, Ay, Cramant, and Bouzy, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
thousands of bottles ready for labelling are stacked in massive piles at the end
of the packing-hall in the corresponding wing of the establishment.
Here, too, a tribe of workpeople are arraying the bottles with gold and
silver headdresses, and robing them in pink paper, while others are
filling, securing, marking, and addressing the cases or baskets destined
to Hong-Kong, San Francisco, Yokohama, Bombay, London, New York, St.
Petersburg, Berlin, or Paris.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PACKING-HALL OF MESSRS. DE ST. MARCEAUX AT REIMS.</p>
</div>

<p>The wine in cask, stored in the left-hand wing, after having been duly
blended in an enormous vat, is drawn off into bottles, which are then
lowered down a shaft to the second tier of cellars by means of an
endless chain, on to which the baskets of bottles are swiftly hooked.
The workman engaged in this duty, in order to guard against his falling
down the shaft, has a leather belt strapped round his waist, by means
of which he is secured to an adjoining iron column. We descended into
the lower cellars down a flight of ninety-three broad steps&mdash;a depth
equal to the height of an ordinary six-storied house&mdash;and found no less
than four-and-twenty galleries excavated in the chalk, devoid of masonry
supports, and containing upwards of a million bottles of Champagne.
These galleries vary in length, but are of uniform breadth, and allow
either for a couple of racks with wine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur pointe</i>, or stacks of
bottles, in four row&rsquo;s on either side, with ample passage-room down the
centre.</p>

<p>The upper range of cellars comprises two large arched galleries of
considerable breadth, one of which contains wine in wood and wine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur
pointe</i>, while the other is stocked with bottles of wine heads downward,
ready to be delivered into the hands of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeur</i>.</p>

<p>MM. de St. Marceaux &amp; Co. have the honour of supplying the King of the
Belgians, the President of the French Republic, and several German
potentates with an exceedingly delicate Champagne known as the Royal St.
Marceaux. The same wine is popular in Russia and other parts of Europe,
just as the Dry Royal of the firm is much esteemed in the United States.
The brand of the house most appreciated in this country is its Carte
d&rsquo;Or, a very dry wine, the extra superior quality of the firm, which
secured the first place at a recent Champagne competition in England.</p>

<p>Some little distance beyond the remnants of the ancient fortifications
of Reims, skirting the Butte de St. Nicaise, is the establishment of
Veuve Morelle &amp; Co., successors to Veuve Max
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Sutaine &amp; Co. This house
was founded in 1823 by the late M. Maxime Sutaine, who, like several
other notabilities in the Reims wine trade, was as familiar with art and
science as with the special industry to which he had devoted himself.
An amateur painter of no mean skill, he showed himself thoroughly at
home in the biographical and critical notices on artists and art in
his native province which he produced. His name, however, is chiefly
identified in literature with his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai sur le Vin de Champagne</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
This work may be regarded as the first attempt to collect the scattered
materials relating to the history of Champagne wine, and to deal with
them in a critical spirit. Though necessarily imperfect, its value is
undoubtedly great, and it has been frequently quoted from in the present
volume. The family of Sutaine long held an honourable position at Reims,
the name of one of M. Max Sutaine&rsquo;s immediate ancestors, who filled the
position of lieutenant of the city in 1765, appearing on the bronze slab
at the base of the statue of Louis XV. in the Place Royale, erected
during that year.</p>

</div>

<p>The cellars of the firm of Veuve Morelle &amp; Co., successors to Max
Sutaine &amp; Co., are very extensive; and while more than usually
picturesque in appearance, are in every respect admirably adapted for
the rearing and development of the delicate wines of the Champagne.
These cellars, hewn out of the chalk, are of great depth. The firm has
been careful to adhere to the good traditions of its predecessors in the
composition of its cuvées, and at the same time to avoid those errors
which experience and the resources of modern science have made manifest.
Its rule is only to send out wines of a good cru, and never before they
are thoroughly matured, thereby avoiding the shipment of young wines.
The chief kinds bearing the brand of Max Sutaine &amp; Co. are Vin Brut
(of great years), Extra Dry, Creaming Sillery, and Bouzy for England,
Sillery Sec for Russia, and Verzenay and Cabinet for Germany and Belgium.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that of late years the abandoned quarries,
so numerous on this side of the city, have been largely utilised by
the Reims Champagne manufacturers as cellars for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
storage of their wines. Beyond the firms that have been already alluded to as
possessing cellars in this direction, there remain to be enumerated
Messrs. Kunkelmann &amp; Co., Ruinart Père et Fils, the Goulets, Jules
Champion, Théophile Roederer, &amp;c. The cellars of several of the last
named are immediately outside the Porte Dieu-Lumière, near which is a
seventeenth-century house having let into its face a curious bas-relief,
of evidently much earlier date, the subject of which has been a source
of considerable perplexity to local antiquaries.</p>

<p>A like cloud enshrouds the origin of the name of Dieu-Lumière, bestowed
upon the fortified gate formerly standing here, and originally erected
during the fourteenth century, when, the circle of the ramparts having
been carried round the Bourg de St. Remi so as to unite it to the old
city, the Porte St. Nicaise was walled up.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Like the other portals
of Reims, it has no lack of historical associations. Its vaulted roof
resounded with the trampling of barbed war-steeds when, on the 16th
July 1429, Charles the Victorious swept beneath it into the city,
with Joan of Arc by his side and the steel-clad chivalry of France at
his back.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The year 1583 saw its keys handed to the Duc de Guise,
and the green flag of the League, with its device &lsquo;Auspice Christo,&rsquo;
hoisted above it; and twenty-three years later, as Henri Quatre rode
through it amidst shouts of welcome, the jesting remark, &lsquo;I had no idea
I was so well beloved at Reims,&rsquo; was the only attempt at revenge made
by the easy-going Béarnais on the population who had so long flouted
his authority. Rebuilt in 1620, it witnessed the triumphant return of
Grandpré&rsquo;s cavalry and the Rémois militia, after their victory over
Montal and his Spaniards at La Pompelle in 1657, and the successful
assault of the renegade Saint Priest, whose Cossacks entered the walls
at this point in 1814, and gave way to the most brutal excesses.
Nor must it be forgotten that Marie Louise passed through this gate
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Paris, on which occasion its summit was crowned with
elaborate allegorical devices supported by cupids weaving garlands of
flowers; or that for several centuries the relics of St. Timotheus and
his companions were annually carried through it on Whit-Monday by the
clergy of Reims, escorted by a procession of pilgrims, to the scene of
the martyrdom of these early Christians at La Pompelle.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">I<span class="smaller">F</span> Reims be the titular capital of the Champagne wine-trade, Epernay can
boast of containing the establishments of some of the most eminent firms
engaged therein. Its connection with the production of the wines of
Champagne is of the remotest. The vineyards stretching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
for miles around
the ancient Sparnacum claim indeed an antiquity far exceeding that of
any existing portion of the town itself, which, despite the remote date
of its foundation, and the fact that it was a place of considerable
importance as early as 445, presents a thoroughly modern aspect. Unlike
Reims&mdash;so rich in the remains of antiquity&mdash;it possesses no mementoes of
the days when its lord Eulogius gave it to St. Remi,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and he in turn
bequeathed it to the Church.</p>

<p>The reason is simple, for the history of Epernay may be briefly summed
up in the words&mdash;fire, pestilence, and pillage. From the days when
misfortune first overtook it, after the division of the Frankish
monarchy on the death of Clovis, it has been burnt down on half a dozen
occasions, repeatedly depopulated by the plague, and captured and sacked
times out of number. The contending sovereigns of Austrasia and Neustria
alternately obtained forcible possession of it, and the rival counts of
Paris and Vermandois snatched it repeatedly from each other&rsquo;s hold, like
hungry dogs contending for a bone; whilst the Normans, the Hungarians,
the vassals of Charles of Lorraine, and the followers of Otho of Germany
added their quota to the work of destruction during the long period of
anarchy preceding the establishment of the Capetian race upon the throne
of France. The founder of the said race, Hugh the Great, distinguished
himself in 947 by plundering the town of Epernay, ravaging the
surrounding country, and profiting by the fact that it was vintage-time
to carry off all the wine of the neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

   <a id="fig270" name="fig270"></a>
   <img class="top2 bottom2" src="images/fig270.jpg"
      alt="Clergyman, Issuing the Blessing" />
</div>

<p>Even during the epoch of comparative tranquillity which prevailed up
to the English invasion, Epernay became from time to time the prey of
robber knights like Thomas de Marlé and rebellious nobles like Count
John of Soissons; and at the commencement of the thirteenth century
Count Thibault of Champagne was fain to burn it, in order to prevent it
from serving as a rallying-place for the lords who had risen against
Queen Blanche and her infant son Louis IX. After the battle of Poitiers
it was pillaged by the partisans of Charles the Bad of Navarre; Edward
the Black Prince entered it twice as a conqueror; and John of Gaunt
exacted a heavy tribute from it. In the struggles which followed
the death of Henry V. of England it was again taken and re-taken,
partially burnt and utterly ruined, remaining for three years absolutely
depopulated after the unwelcome visit paid it by the Duke of Burgundy in
1432.</p>

<p>Yet during all these ravages the vineyards clothing the slopes around
the town were gradually developed, chiefly by the fostering care of
the good fathers of the Abbey of St. Martin. The charter of foundation
of this abbey, which was endowed in 1032, makes mention of vineyards
amongst its possessions, and they are also spoken of in the confirmation
of donations and privileges granted by Pope Eugenius III. in 1145. Count
Henry of Champagne in 1179 gave the canons of the abbey the hospital
of Epernay, with the fields and vineyards belonging to it; and twenty
years later, Abbot Guy purchased from Abbot Noah, of the monastery of
the Chapelle aux Planches, near Troyes, the fields, vineyards, house,
barn, and garden adjoining the &lsquo;ruisseau du Cotheau&rsquo; at Epernay for 110
livres. In 1203, Parchasius, a canon of Laon, left by will to the abbey
the &lsquo;vigne du Clozet,&rsquo; which is still celebrated for the excellence
of its products, at Epernay; and in 1217, Abbot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Theodoric gave the
&lsquo;terres de la Croix Boson&rsquo; at Mardeuil to sundry of the inhabitants of
that village, on the condition of planting them with vines and paying a
yearly rent of fourteen hogsheads of wine obtained therefrom as vinage.
Tithes of wine at Oger, Cuis, Cramant, Monthelon, &amp;c., and the vineyards
of Genselin, Beaumont, and Montfelix also figure amongst the possessions
of the abbey in the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>A certain proportion of the tithes of the &lsquo;fields, meadows, and
vineyards&rsquo; owned by the abbey at Epernay was assigned to the dependent
priory in the faubourg of Igny-le-Jard by Abbot Richard de Cuys in 1365.
The cultivation of the grape seems to have been carried on in even
the most distant of the numerous possessions of the abbey, which drew
&lsquo;rentes de vin&rsquo; from Chatillon and Dormans; and in 1373 we find Abbot
Gilles de Baronne compelling an unfortunate inhabitant of Romains, near
Fismes, to demolish forthwith a wine-press he had dared to erect to the
prejudice of the &lsquo;droits seigneuriaux et bannaux&rsquo; which the abbey had
over that village. The military orders had their share, too; for the
Commandery of the Temple at Reims owned at Epernay at the commencement
of the fourteenth century a house and some vineyards, still bearing the
name of &lsquo;Les Tempières.&rsquo; In 1419, Philippe le Maître and his wife left
to the curé of Epernay a little vineyard at Montebon to pay for a yearly
mass; and at a somewhat later date, Isabelle la Linotte bequeathed to
the abbey the vineyard De la Ronce at Mardeuil.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, the history of Epernay is most intimately connected with that of
its wine, which figures throughout its records as a constant attraction
to friends and foes. After the final expulsion of the English, the town
gradually recovered its prosperity, and became an appanage of the Dukes
of Orleans. At the commencement of the sixteenth century we find Francis
I.&mdash;to whom it had reverted on the death of Louise of Savoy&mdash;presenting
it to Claude, Duke of Guise, and the eschevins resolving in 1544 that
their new seigneur should be offered &lsquo;twenty poinçons of the best
wine that can be found in the cellars of the district, and that after
the vintage twenty more of the new crop shall be sent to him.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> A
levy of one hundred poinçons had already been demanded of them for the
camp formed by the King at Rethel two years before; and the various
strongholds of the province had been freely supplied with wine exacted
from Epernay by the Duke de Longueville, lieutenant-governor of the
Champagne.</p>

<p>On the advance of Charles V. in 1544, the Dauphin, afterwards Henri
II., following the example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
successfully set by Anne de Montmorency
in Provence, pitilessly sacked the entire district of the Marne, in
order that the enemy might find nothing to live on, and stored the
product, which included an enormous quantity of wine, in Epernay. The
Emperor advanced, meeting with but little opposition, and having taken
up his quarters in the Abbey of Avenay, amused himself with building
the vendangeoir known as Charles-Fontaine on the adjacent slope, as a
testimony of his intention to make, if possible, a permanent sojourn in
a province, the vinous products of which he so highly esteemed.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
But whilst the illustrious patron of Titian and his &lsquo;swarthy grave
commanders&rsquo; were snugly tippling the choicest vintages contained in the
abbey cellars, and his followers camped outside Epernay were waiting for
the hour when they should revel at pleasure on the wine stored in the
town, their hopes vanished literally in smoke. For Francis, fearing the
town would be unable to hold out, had sent word to Captain Sery to burn
it, and destroy the accumulated store of provisions, in order to prevent
them falling into the hands of the enemy. This was accordingly done on
the 3d September, and amongst the property consumed were the immense
pressoirs of the Abbey of St. Martin. In this conflagration the church
of Epernay was no doubt also destroyed, as the handsome Renaissance
doorway&mdash;the sole ancient portion of the existing edifice&mdash;was evidently
erected in the latter half of the sixteenth century. The misfortunes of
the town did not cease with this calamity, for a great pestilence seems
to have marked the return of the inhabitants to their ruined dwellings
at the epoch of the following vintage.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>

Five years later, six
arpents of the &lsquo;terre de siege&rsquo; where the Spaniards had encamped were
planted with vines by the Count de Nanteuil-le-Haudouin, and received
the name of the Vineyard de la Plante.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>As a matter of course, the hapless fate of the town pursued it during
the religious wars of the sixteenth century. In 1567 the Huguenots,
under Condé, seized on Epernay&mdash;then a portion of the appanage of the
unfortunate Marie Stuart of Scotland&mdash;and exacted a ransom of 10,500
livres, towards which the Abbey of St. Martin contributed 3451 livres,
partly in money and partly in wine, calculated at no more than eleven
livres the queue. A higher price appears to have ruled on the recapture
of the town by the Duke of Guise the same year, when the levy made
consisted of 500 pièces of wine, estimated at twenty-four livres the
queue.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Guise was driven out by the inhabitants in 1588; but after
one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
fruitless assault, the Leaguers under Rosné succeeded in obtaining
forcible possession of Epernay four years later.</p>

<p>On Henri Quatre laying siege in turn to Epernay in 1592, the vineyards
around the town were again literally watered with blood. One notable
episode of this siege was the death of Maréchal Biron, the most devoted
of Henri&rsquo;s adherents. On the 27th July the King and Biron were returning
on horseback from Damery to the camp. As they advanced up the road
leading from Mardeuil to the faubourg of Igny, the wind blew off Henri&rsquo;s
hat, adorned with the famous white plume, and Biron, picking it up,
jestingly placed it upon his own head. At this moment the white plume
unluckily caught the eye of Petit, the master gunner of Epernay, and he
at once pointed a cannon at it from the Tour Saint Antoine. &lsquo;For the
Béarnais!&rsquo; he exclaimed, as he fired; and the ball carried away the head
of the Maréchal, to whom Henri was speaking, and upon whose shoulder the
King&rsquo;s hand was actually resting. &lsquo;Ah, mordieu, the dog has bitten the
Béarnais!&rsquo; cried the exulting gunner, believing it was the King who had
fallen, and alluding to the name of the cannon, which was known as the
&lsquo;Dog of Orleans,&rsquo; from its having been captured from the English at the
siege of that city, and bearing on its breech the figure of a dog.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The death of Maréchal Biron, and the fact that Henri was devoting quite
as much attention to his &lsquo;belle hôtesse&rsquo; at Damery, the fair Présidente
Anne du Puy, as he was to the siege, encouraged St. Paul, who commanded
at Reims for the League, to despatch a strong body of Walloon pikemen
and musketeers to the relief of the beleaguered town. They approached
by the hollow road leading from the Faubourg des Ponts Neufs to the
slope of the Vignes des Capinets, and passing between the vineyards
Dure Epine and Gouttes d&rsquo;Or. Attacked by the Royalists, they drew up
in good order in the latter spot, and prepared to defend themselves
with all the stubborn valour of their race, their dense array of pikes
bristling amongst the bright green leaves&mdash;for it was the close of
summer, and the vines were in all the glory of their luxuriant foliage.
Vainly for a long time the Royalists assailed them. Attack after attack
was repulsed, till the &lsquo;golden drops&rsquo; were turned to drops of gore; and
it was not until the white plume of King Henri came dashing on in the
forefront of his choicest cavalry that the Walloons were finally broken
and routed, after inflicting upon their assailants a far greater loss than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
they themselves sustained. The vineyard thus baptised in blood was
thenceforward known as the Vigne des Sièges.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>Though data may be lacking to connect the &lsquo;bon Roi Henri&rsquo; directly with
the wine of Epernay, there can be no doubt that the sovereign whose
triple talent for drinking, fighting, and love-making has been handed
down to us in song<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> found a fair opportunity of exercising all three
of these attributes during the siege. Of fighting, as we have seen,
he had plenty, and, Anacreon-like, he seems to have blended love and
wine together.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> He who, when a new-born babe, had his lips wetted
in the old castle of Pau by stout Antoine de Bourbon with a cup of the
generous wine of the South, and who gloried in the title of the Sieur
d&rsquo;Ay, was not likely to neglect the nectar vintaged on the slopes around
Epernay. And probably the recollection of the raven-haired, black-eyed,
bronze-skinned Bernais peasant-girls, whom tradition vows he used to woo
when in the first flush of youthful manhood beneath the trellised vines
of Jurançon and Gan, served by contrast to heighten the fairer charms of
the blonde Anne du Puy, in whose honour he is reported to have sung:</p>

<p>At the outset of the seventeenth century Epernay had its full share in
the troubles that marked the early part of the reign of Louis XIII.,
being taken in turn by Condé, by the Count de Soissons, acting for
the malcontent nobles leagued against Richelieu in 1634, and by the
King&rsquo;s forces the year following. The peaceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
records are, however,
plentiful and interesting. In 1631 we find the town council deciding to
present &lsquo;six caques of white wine, the best that can be found,&rsquo; to M. de
Vignolles, and the same to M. d&rsquo;Elbenne; and two years later protesting
to the &lsquo;treasurers of France&rsquo; their inability to pay 70,000 livres,
demanded towards the maintenance of the army, owing to the all but total
failure of the wine crop. The council were fully aware of the merits of
their vintage, and of the advantages of appealing to the heart by way of
the stomach. Six &lsquo;feuillettes&rsquo; of the best wine were ordered to be sent
in September 1636 to M. de Vaubecourt, and one to his secretary, &lsquo;to
retain their good-will towards the town,&rsquo; and induce the former to use
his influence with a committee appointed by the King for repaying loans
and advances, and also towards getting rid of the garrison. A little
later the Marquis de Senneterre received a queue of wine to withdraw his
troops from the town. The Maréchal de Chatillon, M. de Vaubecourt, M.
de Belfonds, and the Count d&rsquo;Estaing were in frequent receipt of such
gifts; and it is noteworthy that amongst them figure &lsquo;two caques of
wine in bottles,&rsquo; sent to each of the two first at Sainte Ménéhoulde in
1639.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The successful efforts of Turenne against his great rival Condé during
the wars of the Fronde were encouraged by frequent presents of the wine
of Epernay. As the brother of the Duc de Bouillon, to whom the town
of Epernay had been given in 1643 in exchange for Sedan, and as the
protector of the district against the Spaniards, he received numerous
tokens of the citizens&rsquo; good-will. In September 1652 twelve caques of
wine were sent to him, with the result that he at once ordered his
soldiers to repair the broken bridge across the Marne. In the following
January a chevreuil and two caques, and in June wine, fowls, and game,
were presented to him. In June 1654 it was resolved that a deputation
should be sent to the coronation of Louis XIV. at Reims, &lsquo;to render the
homage due to the King,&rsquo; and to present &lsquo;a caque of wine in bottles&rsquo; to
M. de Turenne, which helped no doubt to spread the fame of the Epernay
wine amongst the nobility present on that occasion.</p>

<p>The same social lever was applied in 1660 to the &lsquo;traitant général&rsquo;
of the so-called &lsquo;don gratuit&rsquo; exacted on the occasion of the King&rsquo;s
marriage, two feuillettes being proffered in order to get him to reduce
the assessment. Representations made to an eschevin of Paris, despatched
to Epernay in 1662 to see if there was any store of grain in the town
that could be sold to benefit the starving poor of the capital, to the
effect that the district was a wine-growing and not a corn country;
and the despatch of a deputation in August 1666 to Louvois, to request
that the garrison might be withdrawn to allow of the vintage being
gathered in&mdash;the inhabitants of the surrounding country having fled to
avoid sheltering soldiers,&mdash;serve to show the importance of the Epernay
wine-trade. In 1671, on the passage of the Duke and Duchess of Orleans
from Châlons, fruit and sweetmeats were presented to them, and wine to
the lords of their suite, at a cost of 211 livres 7 sols; and two years
later, Louis XIV. partook of the local vintage during his sojourn at the
&lsquo;maison abbatiale,&rsquo; when on his way to the army of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this century the wine grew in repute, and was
eagerly sought after. In November 1677 two caques were sent to &lsquo;a person
who enjoys some credit,&rsquo; and who was willing to accord his protection to
the town in the matter of quartering troops upon it; and the following
January twelve more caques were despatched to this &lsquo;unknown,&rsquo; who may
have been Louvois himself. As to Roger Brulart, Marquis de Puisieux
et de Sillery and Governor of Epernay, a joyous companion, if we may
credit St. Simon, his appreciation of the local vintage is borne ample
testimony to. In 1677 six caques of &lsquo;the best&rsquo; were sent to him by the
town council; but by 1691 he must have become used to larger offerings,
as in September a letter was addressed to him begging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
him to be
satisfied with the like amount, as &lsquo;the inhabitants could not manage
more,&rsquo; and could only promise, with regard to three caques still due,
that they would &lsquo;make an effort&rsquo; to supply them the following year.
Wise in their generation, they sent at the same time &lsquo;twelve bottles of
the best wine&rsquo; to his intendant, and a similar gift to his secretary;
but the following year they were forced to write again that it would be
impossible to supply the wine promised unless he obtained a permission
to levy it.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The Old Pretender, or, as he is styled in the local records, &lsquo;Jacques
Stuart III., roy d&rsquo;Angleterre,&rsquo; arrived at Epernay in September 1712,
and was presented with &lsquo;twenty-four bottles of the best;&rsquo; whilst the
Marquis de Puisieux, who accompanied him, was satisfied with nothing
less than a &lsquo;carteau,&rsquo; or quarter-cask. And when the latter announced
his intention of paying a visit in the autumn of 1719 to Maître
Adam Bertin du Rocheret, conseiller du roy and ex-president of the
Grenier-à-sel at Epernay, a resolution was passed to offer him wine on
his arrival, and to send &lsquo;a hundred <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flasks</i> of the best&rsquo; to his château
of Sillery. The use of the word &lsquo;flaçons&rsquo; clearly implies that the
discoveries of Dom Perignon were being acted upon at Epernay, and that
the gift in question was one of sparkling wine.</p>

<p>In June 1722 the Sieurs Quatresous and Chertemps, despatched to
congratulate the marquis&rsquo;s nephew and successor, Louis Philogène
Brulart, on his appointment to the governorship of the town and his
marriage with Mademoiselle de Souvré, granddaughter of Louvois,
took with them a similar offering. At the coronation of Louis XV.,
in October, deputies were sent to compliment the Prince de Turenne,
representative of his father the Duc de Bouillon, seigneur d&rsquo;Epernay,
and to present him with &lsquo;game, trout, and other fish,&rsquo; and &lsquo;a basket of
a hundred flasks of the best.&rsquo; In August 1725 the bourgeois were drawn
up under arms, and four dozen bottles were got ready, on the passage
through the town of the Duke of Orleans, son of the late Regent, on
his way to espouse, as the King&rsquo;s proxy, Marie Leczinska. This was,
however, a sad year for the wine-growers, for ten months of incessant
rain, beginning in April, not only ruined the at first promising crop
entirely, but caused floods which wrought some havoc. The terrible
hail-storm of 1730, which devastated the vineyards of Reims, fortunately
spared those of Epernay; but a frost in October 1740 destroyed the
vintage, and led to a dearness of provisions which pressed even on the
most well-to-do.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>For the next three-quarters of a century Epernay continued quietly
to profit by the yield of &lsquo;the slopes laden with vines producing the
most delicious wines in Europe,&rsquo; to quote the expression of Stapart,
who in 1749 notes the importance of the trade in wine carried on,
not only with Paris, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
with foreign countries; though at the same
time complaining of the decreasing size of the town, and the fact of
vineyards being planted where houses had formerly stood.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> The
only events of importance were from time to time an unusually good
or an uncommonly bad crop, or&mdash;as the manufacture of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i>
gradually swallowed up that of still wine&mdash;a disastrous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casse</i>, like
the memorable one of 1776, varied by an occasional royal visit or so.
By 1780, Max Sutaine notes that a single manufacturer would turn out
from five to six thousand bottles of sparkling Champagne, and exults
over the fact that seven years later an enterprising firm risked a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirage</i> of fifty thousand, though people at the time regarded this as
something prodigious, and wondered where an outlet would be found.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
Very likely a bottle of this identical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirage</i> was &lsquo;the excellent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
mousseux</i>&rsquo; with which Arthur Young regaled himself, at a cost of forty
sous, on the 7th July of the same year, at that &lsquo;very good inn&rsquo; the
Hôtel de Rohan, at Epernay.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> At this same inn the hapless Louis XVI.
stopped to dine on his return from the intercepted flight to Varennes;
and when we recall his timid nature, we may fairly surmise that it was
Champagne which inspired him, amidst the insults of the mob, to remind
the authorities that his ancestor, Henri Quatre, had entered the town in
a very different fashion, and by implication to assert that he might yet
do the same.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon, the Empress Josephine, the King of Westphalia,
and the other members of the Bonaparte dynasty, who from time to time
visited Epernay and partook of the hospitality of Jean Remi Moët,
showed a healthy appreciation of its vintage. Indeed King Jerome, in
giving an order for six thousand bottles <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier cru</i>, remarked with
a strange foresight that he would have taken more, only he was afraid
that it would be the Russians after all who would come and drink it.
Sure enough the eventful year 1814 witnessed the arrival at Epernay of
a host of self-invited guests, all equally appreciative of the merits
of Champagne, and gifted with an almost unlimited power of consumption,
but entertaining insuperable objections to pay for what they consumed.
The Prussians and Russians who came hither in February and March
misconducted themselves in a very sad manner, burning and pillaging
houses, insulting and maltreating the inhabitants, requisitioning all
the wine they could lay hands on, and drinking in a manner recalling the
Bacchic exploits of Gargantua and Pantagruel. The mayor, Jean Remi Moët,
moved by the state of affairs, offered the invaders the free run of his
cellars rather than that they should pillage those of others, doubtless
under the idea that the reputation his house would thus acquire abroad
would soon enable him to retrieve the temporary loss&mdash;a proviso happily
and amply realised. Beyond the facts that Epernay has profited, and
continues to profit, by the ever-increasing development of the taste
for sparkling wine; that Charles X., Louis Philippe, and Napoleon III.
have successively favoured it with their presence, and accepted the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
d&rsquo;honneur</i> offered on such occasions; and that during the war of 1870&ndash;1
the town, in common with the rest of the province of Champagne, was
occupied by the German invading army, there is nothing more to be said
respecting its history.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">T<span class="smaller">HOSE</span> magnates of the Champagne trade, Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon, whose
famous &lsquo;Star&rsquo; brand is familiar in every part of the civilised globe,
and whose half-score miles of cellars contain as many million bottles of
Champagne as there are millions of inhabitants in most of the secondary
European States, have their head-quarters at Epernay in a spacious
château&mdash;in that street of châteaux named the Rue du Commerce, but
commonly known as the Faubourg de la Folie&mdash;which is approached through
handsome iron gates, and has beautiful gardens in the rear extending
in the direction of the River Marne. The existing firm dates from the
year 1833, but the family of Moët&mdash;conjectured to have originally come
from the Low Countries&mdash;had already been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
associated with the Champagne
wine trade for well-nigh a century previously. If the Moëts came from
Holland they must have established themselves in the Champagne at a
very early date, for the annals of Reims record that in the fourteenth
century Jehan Moët de Mennemont, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">escuier</i>, held a fief at Attigny from
the Archbishop Richard Pique, and that in the following century Jean
and Nicolas Moët were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échevins</i> of the city. A Moët was present in
that capacity at the coronation of Charles VII. in 1429, when Joan of
Arc stood erect by the principal altar of the cathedral with her sacred
banner in her hand; and for having contributed to repulse an attempt on
the part of the English to prevent the entrance of the Royal party into
the city, the Moëts were subsequently ennobled by the same monarch. A
mural tablet in the church of St. Remi records the death of D. G. Moët,
Grand Prior, in 1554; and nine years later we find Nicol Moët claiming
exemption at Epernay for the payment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tailles</i> on the ground of his
being a noble.</p>

<p>An old commercial book preserved in the family archives shows that in
the year 1743&mdash;at the epoch when the rashness of the Duc de Grammont
saved the English army under George II. from being cut to pieces at
Dettingen&mdash;a descendant of the foregoing, one Claude Louis Nicolas Moët,
who owned considerable vineyard property in the vicinity of Epernay,
decided upon embarking in the wine trade. It is his son, however,
Jean Remi Moët, born in 1758, who may be looked upon as the veritable
founder of the present commerce in Champagne wines, which, thanks to
his efforts, received a wonderful impulse, so that instead of the
consumption of the vintages of the Marne being limited as heretofore to
the privileged few, it spread all over the civilised world.</p>

</div>

<p>At Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s we had the opportunity of inspecting some of
the old account-books of the firm, and more particularly those recording
the transactions of Jean Remi Moët and his father. The first sales of
sparkling wine, on May 23d, 1743, comprised 301 bottles of the vintage
of 1741 to Pierre Joly, wine-merchant, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon des douze chez le Roi</i>,
whatever that may mean, at Paris; 120 bottles to Pierre Gabriel Baudoin,
also <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon des douze</i>, at Paris; and a similar quantity to the Sieur
Compoin, keeping the &lsquo;hotellerie ditte la pestitte Escurie,&rsquo; Rue du
Port-Maillart, at Nantes in Brittany. The entry specifies that the wine
for Nantes is to be left at Choisy-le-Roi, and taken by land to Orleans
by the carters of that town, who are to be found at the Ecu d&rsquo;Orléans,
Porte St. Michel, Paris, the carriage as far as Choisy being 4 livres 10
deniers (about 4 francs) for the two half-baskets, and to Paris 3 livres
15 deniers the basket.</p>

<p>Between 1750 and &rsquo;60 parcels of wine were despatched to Warsaw, Vienna,
Berlin, Königsberg, Dantzig, Stettin, Brussels, and Amsterdam; but one
found no mention of any sales to England till the year 1788, when the
customers of the firm included &lsquo;Milord&rsquo; Farnham, of London, and Messrs.
Felix Calvert &amp; Sylvin, who had a couple of sample-bottles sent to them,
for which they were charged five shillings. In the same year Messrs.
Carbonnell, Moody, &amp; Walker (predecessors of the well-known existing
firm of Carbonnell &amp; Co.) wrote in French for two baskets, of ten dozens
each, of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin de Champagne</i> &lsquo;of good body, not too charged with liqueur,
but of excellent taste, and not at all sparkling.&rsquo; The Chevalier
Colebrook, writing from Bath, also requests that 72 bottles of Champagne
may be sent to his friend the Hon. John Butler, Molesworth-street,
Dublin, &lsquo;who, if contented with the wine, will become a good customer,
he being rich, keeping a good house, and receiving many amateurs of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
de Champagne</i>.&rsquo; Shortly afterwards the Chevalier himself receives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
50 bottles of still wine, vintage 1783. In 1789 120 bottles of Champagne,
vintage 1788, are supplied to &lsquo;Milord&rsquo; Findlater, of London; and in 1790
the customers of the house include Power &amp; Michel, of 44 Lamb-street,
London, and Manning, of the St. Alban Tavern, the latter of whom is
supplied on March 30th with 130 bottles of Champagne at three livres, or
two &lsquo;schillings,&rsquo; per bottle; while a month later Mr. Lockart, banker,
of 36 Pall Mall, is debited with 360 bottles, vintage 1788, at three
shillings.</p>

<p>In this same year M. Moët despatches a traveller to England named
Jeanson, and his letters, some two hundred in number, are all preserved
in the archives of the house. On the 17th May 1790 he writes from
London as follows: &lsquo;As yet I have only gone on preparatory and often
useless errands. I have distributed samples of which I have no news.
Patience is necessary, and I endeavour to provide myself with it. How
the taste of this country has changed since ten years ago! Almost
everywhere they ask for dry wine, but at the same time require it so
vinous and so strong that there is scarcely any other than the wine
of Sillery which can satisfy them.... To-morrow I dine five miles
from here, at M. Macnamara&rsquo;s. We shall uncork four bottles of our
wine, which will probably be all right.&rsquo; In May 1792 Jean Remi Moët is
married, and thenceforward assumes the full management of the house. On
December 20 of the year following, when the Reign of Terror was fairly
inaugurated, we find the accounts in the ledger opened to this or the
other &lsquo;citoyen.&rsquo; The orthodox Republican formula, however, did not long
continue, and &lsquo;sieur&rsquo; and &lsquo;monsieur&rsquo; resumed their accustomed places,
showing that Jean Remi Moët had no sympathy with the Jacobin faction of
the day. In 1805 he became Mayor of Epernay, and between this time and
the fall of the Empire received Napoleon several times at his residence,
as well as the Empress Josephine and the King of Westphalia. The
Emperor, after recapturing Reims from the Allies, came on to Epernay,
on which occasion he presented M. Moët with the Cross of the Legion of
Honour. In 1830 the latter was arbitrarily dismissed from his mayoralty
by Charles X., but was speedily reinstated by Louis Philippe, though he
did not retain his office for long, his advanced age compelling him to
retire from active life in the course of 1833. At this epoch the firm,
which since 1807 had been known as Moët &amp; Co., was remodelled under the
style of Moët &amp; Chandon, the two partners being M. Victor Moët, son of
the outgoing partner, and M. P. G. Chandon, the descendant of an old
ennobled family of the Mâconnais, who had married M. Jean Remi Moët&rsquo;s
eldest daughter. The descendants of these gentlemen are to-day (1880) at
the head of the business, the partners being, on the one hand, M. Victor
Moët-Romont and M. C. J. V. Auban Moët-Romont; and on the other, MM.
Paul and Raoul Chandon de Briailles.</p>

<p>Facing Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s offices at Epernay is a range of
comparatively new buildings, with its white façade ornamented with
the well-known monogram M. &amp; C., surmounted by the familiar star.
It is here that the business of blending and bottling the wine is
carried on. Passing through the arched gateway, access is obtained
to a spacious courtyard, where carts laden with bottles are being
expeditiously lightened of their fragile contents by the busy hands of
numerous workmen. Another gateway on the left leads into the spacious
bottle-washing room, which from the middle of May until the middle
of July presents a scene of extraordinary animation. Bottle-washing
apparatus, supplied by a steam-engine with 20,000 gallons of water
per diem, are ranged in fifteen rows down the entire length of this
hall, and nearly 200 women strive to excel each other in diligence
and celerity in their management, a practised hand washing from 900
to 1000 bottles in the course of the day. To the right of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle
de rinçage</i>, as it is styled, bottles are stacked in their tens of
thousands, and lads furnished with barrows, known as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diables</i>, hurry to
and fro, conveying these to the washers, or removing the clean bottles
to the adjacent courtyard, where they are allowed to drain prior to
being taken to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de tirage</i> or bottling-room.</p>

<p>Before, however, the washing of bottles on this gigantic scale
commences, the &lsquo;marrying&rsquo; or blending of the wine is accomplished in a
vast apartment, 250 feet in length and 100 feet broad, during the early
spring. The casks of newly-vintaged wine, which have been stowed away
during the winter months in the extensive range of cellars hewn out of
the chalk underlying Epernay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
where they have slowly fermented, are
mixed together in due proportion in huge vats, each holding upwards
of 12,000 gallons. Some of this wine is the growth of Messrs. Moët &amp;
Chandon&rsquo;s own vineyards, of which they possess as many as 900 acres
(giving constant employment to 800 labourers and vinedressers) at Ay,
Avenay, Bouzy, Cramant, Champillon, Chouilly, Dizy, Epernay, Grauves,
Hautvillers, Le Mesnil, Moussy, Pierry, Saran, St. Martin, Verzy, and
Verzenay, and the average annual cost of cultivating which is about
£40 per acre. At Ay the firm own 210 acres of vineyards; at Cramant
and Chouilly, nearly 180 acres; at Verzy and Verzenay, 120 acres; at
Pierry and Grauves, upwards of 100 acres; at Hautvillers, 90 acres;
at Le Mesnil, 80 acres; at Epernay, nearly 60 acres; and at Bouzy,
55 acres. Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon, moreover, possess vendangeoirs,
or pressing-houses, at Ay, Bouzy, Cramant, Epernay, Hautvillers, Le
Mesnil, Pierry, Saran, and Verzenay, in which the large number of 40
presses are installed. At these vendangeoirs no less than 5450 pièces
of fine white wine, sufficient for 1,360,000 bottles of Champagne, are
annually made&mdash;that is, 1200 pièces at Ay, 1100 at Cramant and Saran,
800 at Verzy and Verzenay, and smaller quantities at the remaining
establishments. All these establishments have their celliers and their
cellars, together with cottages for the accommodation of the numerous
vinedressers in the employment of the firm.</p>

<p>Extensive as are the vineyards owned by Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon, the
yield from them is utterly inadequate to the enormous demand which
the great Epernay firm are annually called upon to supply, and large
purchases have to be made by their agents from the growers throughout
the Champagne. The wine thus secured, as well as that grown by the firm,
is duly mixed together in such proportions as will insure lightness with
the requisite vinosity, and fragrance combined with effervescence, a
thorough amalgamation being effected by stirring up the wine with long
poles provided with fan-shaped ends. If the vintage be indifferent in
quality, the firm have scores of huge tuns filled with the yield of
more favoured seasons to fall back upon to insure any deficiencies of
character and flavour being supplied.</p>

</div>

<p>The casks of wine to be blended are raised from the cellars, half a
dozen at a time, by means of a lift provided with an endless chain,
and worked by the steam-engine of which we have already spoken. They
are emptied, through traps in the floor of the room above, into the
huge vats which, standing upon a raised platform, reach almost to the
ceiling. From these vats the fluid is allowed to flow through hose into
rows of casks stationed below. Before being bottled the wine reposes for
a certain time; is next duly racked and again blended; and is eventually
conveyed through silver-plated pipes into oblong reservoirs, each fitted
with a dozen syphon-taps, so arranged that directly the bottle slipped
on to one of them becomes full the wine ceases to flow.</p>

<p>Upwards of 200 workpeople are employed in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de tirage</i> at
Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s, which, while the operation of bottling is
going on, presents a scene of bewildering activity. Men and lads are
gathered round the syphon-taps, briskly removing the bottles as they
become filled, and supplanting them by empty ones. Other lads hasten to
transport the filled bottles on trucks to the corkers, whose so-called
&lsquo;guillotine&rsquo; machines send the corks home with a sudden thud. The
corks being secured with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agrafes</i>, the bottles are placed in large
flat baskets called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manettes</i>, and wheeled away on trucks, the quarts
being deposited in the cellars by means of lifts, while the pints
slide down an inclined plane by the aid of an endless chain, which
raises the trucks with the empty baskets at the same time the full
ones make their descent into the cellars. What with the incessant thud
of the corking-machines, the continual rolling of iron-wheeled trucks
over the concrete floor, the rattling and creaking of the machinery
working the lifts, the occasional sharp report of a bursting bottle,
and the loudly-shouted orders of the foremen, who display the national
partiality for making a noise to perfection, the din becomes at times
all but unbearable. The number of bottles filled in the course of the
day naturally varies, still Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon reckon that during
the month of June a daily average of 100,000 are taken in the morning
from the stacks in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de rinçage</i>, washed, dried, filled,
corked, wired, lowered into the cellars, and carefully arranged in
symmetrical order. This represents a total of two and a half million
bottles during that month alone.</p>

<p>The bottles on being lowered into the cellars, either by means of the
incline or the lifts, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
placed in a horizontal position, and, with
their uppermost side daubed with white chalk, are stacked in layers from
two to half a dozen bottles deep, with narrow oak laths between. The
stacks are usually about 6 or 7 feet high, and 100 feet and upwards in
length. Whilst the wine is thus reposing in a temperature of about 55°
Fahrenheit, fermentation sets in, and the ensuing month is one of much
anxiety. Thanks, however, to the care bestowed, Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s
annual loss from bottles bursting rarely exceeds three per cent, though
fifteen was once regarded as a respectable and satisfactory average. The
broken glass is a perquisite of the workmen, the money arising from its
sale, which at the last distribution amounted to no less than 20,000
francs, being divided amongst them every couple of years.</p>

</div>

<p>The usual entrance to Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s Epernay cellars&mdash;which,
burrowed out in all directions, are of the aggregate length of nearly
seven miles, and have usually between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 bottles
and 20,000 casks of wine stored therein&mdash;is through a wide and imposing
portal, and down a long and broad flight of steps. It is, however,
by the ancient and less imposing entrance, through which more than
one crowned head has condescended to pass, that we set forth on our
lengthened tour through these intricate underground galleries&mdash;this
subterranean city, with its miles of streets, cross-roads, open
spaces, tramways, and stations devoted solely to Champagne. A gilt
inscription on a black-marble tablet testifies that &lsquo;on the 26th July
1807, Napoleon the Great, Emperor of the French, King of Italy, and
Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, honoured commerce by
visiting the cellars of Jean Remi Moët, Mayor of Epernay, President
of the Canton, and Member of the General Council of the Department,&rsquo;
within three weeks of the signature of the treaty of Tilsit. Passing
down the flight of steep slippery steps traversed by the victor of Eylau
and Jena, access is gained to the upper range of vaults, brilliantly
illuminated by the glare of gas, or dimly lighted by the flickering
flame of tallow-candles, upwards of 60,000 lb. of which are annually
consumed. Here group after group of the small army of 350 workmen
employed in these subterranean galleries are encountered, engaged in
the process of transforming the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Champagne. At Messrs.
Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s, the all-important operation of liqueuring the wine is
effected by aid of machines of the latest construction, which regulate
the quantity administered to the utmost nicety. The corks are branded by
being pressed against steel dies heated by gas by women, who can turn
out 3000 per day apiece, the quantity of string used to secure them
amounting to nearly ten tons in the course of the year.</p>

</div>

<p>There is another and a lower depth of cellars to be explored, to
which access is gained by trap-holes in the floor&mdash;through which the
barrels and baskets of wine are raised and lowered&mdash;and by flights of
steps. From the foot of the latter there extends an endless vista of
lofty and spacious passages hewn out of the chalk, the walls of which,
smooth as finished masonry, are lined with thousands of casks of raw
wine, varied at intervals by gigantic vats. Miles of long, dark-brown,
dampish-looking galleries stretch away to the right and left, devoid
of the picturesque festoons of fungi which decorate the London Dock
vaults, yet exhibiting a sufficient degree of mouldiness to give them
an air of respectable antiquity. These multitudinous galleries, lit
up by petroleum-lamps, are mostly lined with wine in bottles stacked
in compact masses to a height of six or seven feet, only room enough
for a single person to pass being left. Millions of bottles are thus
arranged, the majority on their side, in huge piles, with tablets hung
up against each stack to note its age and quality; and the rest, which
are undergoing daily evolutions at the hands of the twister, in racks
at various angles of inclination. These cellars contain nearly 11,000
racks, and as many as 600,000 bottles are commonly twisted here daily.</p>

<div class="figleft">
   <a id="fig291" name="fig291"></a>
   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig291.jpg"
      alt="Corridors of a Champagne Cellar" />
</div>

<p>The way runs on between regiments of bottles of the same size and shape,
save where at intervals pints take the place of quarts; and the visitor,
gazing into the black depths of the transverse passages to the right and
left, becomes conscious of a feeling that if his guide were suddenly
to desert him, he would feel as hopelessly lost as in the catacombs
of Rome. There are two galleries, each 650 feet in length, containing
about 650,000 bottles, and connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
by 32 transverse galleries, with
an aggregate length of 4000 feet, in which nearly 1,500,000 bottles are
stored. There are, further, eight galleries, each 500 feet in length,
and proportionably stocked; also the extensive new vaults, excavated
some five or six years back, in the rear of the then existing cellarage,
and a considerable number of smaller vaults. The different depths and
varying degrees of moisture afford a choice of temperature of which the
experienced owners know how to take advantage. The original vaults,
wherein more than a century ago the first bottles of Champagne made
by the infant firm were stowed away, bear the name of Siberia, on
account of their exceeding coldness. This section consists of several
roughly-excavated low winding galleries, resembling natural caverns, and
affording a striking contrast to the broad, lofty, and regular-shaped
corridors of more recent date.</p>

<p>When the proper period arrives for the bottles to emerge once more into
the upper air, they are conveyed to the packing-room, a spacious hall
180 feet long and 60 feet broad. In front of its three large double
doors wagons are drawn up ready to receive their loads. The 70 men and
women employed here easily foil, label, wrap, and pack up some 10,000
bottles a day. Cases and baskets are stacked in different parts of
this vast hall, at one end of which numerous trusses of straw used in
the packing are piled. Seated at tables ranged along one side of the
apartment women are busily occupied in pasting on labels or encasing the
necks of bottles in gold or silver foil, whilst elsewhere men, seated on
three-legged stools in front of smoking caldrons of molten sealing-wax
of a deep green hue, are coating the necks of other bottles by plunging
them into the boiling fluid. When labelled and decorated with either wax
or foil, the bottles pass on to other women, who swathe them in pink
tissue-paper and set them aside for the packers, by whom, after being
deftly wrapped round with straw, they are consigned to baskets or cases,
to secure which last no less than 10,000 lb. of nails are annually used.
England and Russia are partial to gold foil, pink paper, and wooden
cases holding a dozen or a couple of dozen bottles of the exhilarating
fluid, whereas other nations prefer waxed necks, disdain pink paper, and
insist on being supplied in wicker baskets containing fifty bottles each.</p>

<p>Some idea of the complex character of so vast an establishment as that
of Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon may be gathered from a mere enumeration of
their staff, which, in addition to twenty clerks and 350 cellarmen
proper, includes numerous agrafe-makers and corkcutters, packers and
carters, wheelwrights and saddlers, carpenters, masons, slaters and
tilers, tinmen, firemen, needlewomen, &amp;c., while the inventory of
objects used by this formidable array of workpeople comprises no fewer
than 1500 distinct heads. A medical man attached to the establishment
gives gratuitous advice to all those employed, and a chemist dispenses
drugs and medicines without charge. While suffering from illness the men
receive half-pay, but should they be laid up by an accident met with
in the course of their work full salary is invariably awarded to them.
As may be supposed, so vast an establishment as this is not without a
provision for those past work, and all the old hands receive liberal
pensions from the firm upon retiring.</p>

<p>It is needless to particularise Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s wines, which
are familiar to all drinkers of Champagne. Still it may be mentioned
that the great Epernay firm, with the view of meeting the requirements
of the time, have lately commenced shipping a high-class <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i>, or
natural Champagne, possessing great vinosity, combined with remarkable
delicacy of flavour. To this fine dry wine the name of &lsquo;Brut Impérial&rsquo;
has been given by the house. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s famous &lsquo;Star&rsquo; brand is
known in all societies, figures equally at clubs and mess-tables, at
garden-parties and picnics, dinners and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i>, and has its place in
hotel <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cartes</i> all over the world. One of the best proofs of the wine&rsquo;s
universal popularity is found in the circumstance that as many as a
thousand visitors from all parts of the world come annually to Epernay
and make the tour of Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s spacious cellars.</p>

<p>A little beyond Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon&rsquo;s, in the broad Rue du Commerce,
we encounter a heavy, ornate, pretentious-looking château, the residence
of the late M. Perrier-Jouët, presenting a striking contrast to the
almost mean-looking premises opposite, where the business of the firm is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
carried on. On the left-hand side of a courtyard surrounded by
low buildings, which serve as celliers, store-houses, packing-rooms,
and the like, are the offices; and from an inner courtyard, where
piles of bottles are stacked under open sheds, the cellars themselves
are reached. Previous to descending into these we passed through the
various buildings, in one of which a party of men were engaged in
disgorging and preparing wine for shipment. In another we noticed one
of those heavy beam presses for pressing the grapes which the more
intelligent manufacturers regard as obsolete, while in a third was the
cuvée vat, holding no more than 2200 gallons. In making their cuvée
the firm commonly mix one part of old wine to three parts of new. An
indifferent vintage, however, necessitates the admixture of a larger
proportion of the older growth. The cellars, like all the more ancient
ones at Epernay, are somewhat straggling and irregular; still they are
remarkably cool, and on the lower floor remarkably damp as well. This,
however, would appear to be no disadvantage, as the breakage in them is
calculated never to exceed 2&thinsp;&frac12; per cent.</p>

<p>The firm have no less than five qualities of wine, and at one of the
recent Champagne competitions at London, where the experts engaged had
no means of identifying the brands submitted to their judgment, Messrs.
Perrier-Jouët&rsquo;s First Quality got classed below a cheaper wine of their
neighbours, Messrs. Pol Roger &amp; Co., and very considerably below the
Extra Sec of Messrs. Périnet et fils, and inferior even to a wine of De
Venoge&rsquo;s, the great Epernay manufacturer of common-class Champagne.</p>

<p>Champagne establishments, combined with the handsome residences of the
manufacturers, line both sides of the long imposing Rue du Commerce at
Epernay. On the left hand is a succession of fine châteaux, commencing
with one belonging to M. Auban Moët, whose terraced gardens overlook
the valley of the Marne, and command views of the vine-clad heights of
Cumières, Hautvillers, Ay, and Mareuil, and the more distant slopes
of Ambonnay and Bouzy; while on the other side of the famous Epernay
thoroughfare we encounter beyond the establishments of Messrs. Moët
&amp; Chandon and Perrier-Jouët the ornate monumental façade which the
firm of Piper &amp; Co.&mdash;of whom Messrs. Kunkelmann &amp; Co. are to-day the
successors&mdash;raised some years since above their extensive cellars. In a
side street at the farther end of the Rue du Commerce stands a château
of red brick, overlooking on the one side an extensive pleasure-garden,
and on the other a spacious courtyard, bounded by celliers, stables,
and bottle-sheds, all of modern construction and on a most extensive
scale. These form the establishment of Messrs. Pol Roger &amp; Co., settled
for many years at Epernay, and known throughout the Champagne for their
large purchases at the epoch of the vintage. From the knowledge they
possess of the best crus, and their relations with the leading vineyard
proprietors, they are enabled whenever the wine is good to acquire large
stocks of it. Having bottled a considerable quantity of the fine wine of
1874, they resolved to profit by the exceptional quality of this vintage
to commence shipping Champagne to England, where their agents, Messrs.
Reuss, Lauteren, &amp; Co., have successfully introduced the new brand.</p>

<p>Passing through a large open gateway, we enter the vast courtyard of
the establishment, which, with arriving and departing carts&mdash;the first
loaded with wine in cask or with new bottles, and the others with cases
of Champagne&mdash;presents rather an animated scene. Under a roof projecting
from the wall of the vast cellier on the right hand a tribe of
&lsquo;Sparnaciennes&rsquo;&mdash;as the feminine inhabitants of Epernay are termed&mdash;are
occupied in washing bottles in readiness for the coming tirage. The
surrounding buildings, most substantially constructed, are not destitute
of architectural pretensions.</p>

<p>The extensive cellier, the area of which is 23,589 square feet, is
understood to be the largest single construction of the kind in the
Champagne district. Built entirely of iron, stone, and brick, its
framework is a perfect marvel of lightness. The roof, consisting of
rows of brick arches, is covered above with a layer of Portland cement,
in order to keep it cool in summer and protect it against the winter
cold, two most desirable objects in connection with the manipulation of
Champagne. Here an endless chain of a new pattern enables wine in bottle
to be lowered and raised with great rapidity to or from the cellars
beneath&mdash;lofty and capacious excavations of two stories, the lower one
of which is reached by a flight of no less than 170 steps.</p>

<p>Less than a couple of miles southward of Epernay, on the high-road to
Troyes, is the village of Pierry, which, unlike most of the Champagne
villages, is one of those happy spots with little or no history. Up to
the close of the seventeenth century it was an insignificant hamlet; but
at that epoch&mdash;when Dom Perignon&rsquo;s discovery gave such an impetus to
the viticultural industry of the Marne&mdash;the waste land lying around it
was broken up and planted with vines, and a number of rich strangers,
chiefly from Epernay, built themselves houses and vendangeoirs here,
and contributed to the erection of the church. The Benedictines of
St.-Pierre-aux-Monts at Châlons, who continued to be the titular
seigneurs of Pierry up to the period of the Revolution, were not
behindhand in attention to their vines, and during the early part of the
eighteenth century the wine vintaged in their Clos St. Pierre, under the
fostering care of Brother Jean Oudart&mdash;whose renown almost equalled that
of Perignon himself&mdash;was very highly esteemed.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>During the eighteenth century Pierry continued to be a favourite
residence of well-to-do landowners,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and was further embellished by
the construction of numerous handsome châteaux, the most interesting,
from a historic point of view, being that formerly belonging to
Cazotte.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> It was here that the ex-Commissary General of the navy
composed the greater part of his works, and elaborated that futile
scheme for the escape of Louis XVI. after Varennes, which was to conduct
its author to the scaffold.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>The visionary dreamer, to whom we owe the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Diable Amoureux</cite>, appears at
Pierry in the triple character of a practical viticulturist, a village
Hampden withstanding with dauntless breast that little tyrant of the
surrounding vineyards&mdash;the Abbot of Hautvillers,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and a local
legislator put forward in the proprietarial interest at the outbreak of
that Revolution<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> which he appears to have foreseen, if not to have
directly prophesied, as he has been credited with doing.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the most imposing of the remaining Pierry châteaux is the one
situate in that part of the village known as Corrigot, and now in the
occupation of Messrs. Gé-Dufaut &amp; Co. Its grandiose aspect, various
courts, charming garden, fine trees, and clear lake justify this firm in
adopting, in combination with an anchor, the title Château de Pierry as
the brand of their wine. Prior to the Revolution the château belonged
to M. de Papillon de Sannois, a fermier-général of that period. The
municipal records of Pierry contain a petition addressed by him to
the authorities in 1791, at a time when a panic prevailed respecting
the forestallers of corn, begging them to institute a formal search
throughout his residence, in order to give the lie to the rumours
accusing him of having bought up and stored away a considerable quantity
of wheat. The municipality accepted his invitation, and the result was a
certificate to the effect that the total amount of wheat and oats stored
there only represented three months&rsquo; consumption for the household.</p>

<p>Messrs. Gé-Dufaut &amp; Co. are the owners of vineyards both in Pierry
and the neighbouring parts, and for upwards of thirty years the
firm have been engaged in preparing and shipping Champagnes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Their cellars, excavated in the mingled stone, chalk, and earth which form
the prevailing soil of the district, extend beneath the vineyards
belonging to the firm, and are walled and vaulted throughout. The
circumstance of their being on one level, slightly below the celliers
of the establishment, is a great convenience as regards the various
manipulations which the wine has to undergo. Considerable reserves of
old wines of the best years are stored in these vaults. The cultivation
of the vineyards owned by the firm, and the pressing, maturing, and
general cellar management of their wines are under the personal
superintendence of the various partners, with a highly satisfactory
result, as is proved by the first-class medal secured by the firm at
the Vienna Exhibition of 1873, and the gold medal awarded to them at
the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Messrs. Gé-Dufaut &amp; Co. ship their wines
to Europe, America, and India, and more especially to England, where
their dry, natural, and unalcoholised Champagne has acquired a deserved
reputation. The firm, moreover, are the officially appointed furnishers
of Champagne to the Courts of Italy and Spain.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> historic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgade</i> of Ay is within a short walk of the station
on the line of railway connecting Epernay with Reims. The road lies
across the light bridge spanning the Marne canal, the tall trees
fringing which hide for a time the clustering houses; still we catch
sight of the steeple of the antique church, relieved by a background of
vine-covered slopes, and of an eighteenth-century château rising above
a mass of foliage. Perched half-way up the slope, covered with &lsquo;golden
plants,&rsquo; which rises in the rear of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
village, the château, with its
long façade of windows, commands the valley of the Marne for miles;
and from the stately-terraced walk, planted with ancient lime-trees,
geometrically clipped in the fashion of the last century, a splendid
view of the distant vineyards of Avize, Cramant, Epernay, and Chouilly
is obtained. The château formed one of a quartette of seignorial
residences which, at the commencement of the present century, belonged
to Balthazar Constance Dangé-Dorçay, whose ancestors had been lords of
Chouilly under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien régime</i>. Dorçay had inherited from an aunt
the châteaux of Ay, Mareuil, Boursault, and Chouilly, together with a
large patrimony in land and money; but a mania for gambling brought him
to utter ruin, and he dispossessed himself of money, lands, and châteaux
in succession, and was reduced, in his old age, to earn a meagre
pittance as a violin-player at the Paris Opera-house. The old château of
Boursault, which still exists contiguous to the stately edifice raised
by Madame Clicquot on the summit of the hill, was risked and lost on
a single game at cards by this pertinacious gamester, whose pressing
pecuniary difficulties compelled him to sell the remaining châteaux one
by one. That of Ay was purchased by M. Froc de la Boulaye, and by him
bequeathed to his cousin the Count de Mareuil, whose son is to-day a
partner in the Champagne house of Ayala &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The wine of Ay, from an early date, has found equal favour in the
eyes of poets and princes. Eustache Deschamps sang its praises in
the fourteenth century, and was echoed a hundred years later by the
anonymous author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglogue sur le Retour de Bacchus</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
Sigismund of Bohemia, the betrayer of John Huss, on visiting France
in 1410, desired to pass through Ay in order to taste the wine at the
place of its production.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Leo X., Charles V., Francis III., and our
own Henry VIII., each had a house in or near Ay; &lsquo;for amongst all the
great affairs of state which these princes had to unravel, supplying
themselves with this vintage was not the least of their cares.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
Malicious tongues have asserted that they were somewhat suspicious
of the honesty of the wine-growers of the district, and, in order to
secure a genuine article, deemed it needful to have a commissioner or
agent resident on the spot, to superintend the making of the wine set
apart for their own consumption.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Tradition still points out, on
the right of the road from Dizy to Ay, a vineyard called Le Léon, as
the one whence the Pope derived his wine, though no traces remain of
the vendangeoir built by the Emperor in a coppice above Ay during the
siege of Epernay in 1544, and still standing in 1727.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> The president
Bertin du Rocheret has celebrated the partiality of a couple of these
potentates for the wine of Ay in some triolets addressed to M. de
Senécé, and published in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercure</cite> in 1728:</p>

<p>In the reign of Henri III. the wines of Ay&mdash;&lsquo;claret and yellowish,
subtile, fine, and in taste very pleasing to the palate, ... yet
therewithal such wines as the Greeks call Oligophora, and as will not
admit the mixture of much water&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>&mdash;were &lsquo;eagerly sought after for

bulk of the vintage of Burgundy was denounced as rough, sour, and harsh;
and that of Bordeaux stigmatised as thick and black; and when good and
bad years were allowed to have a considerable influence upon the growths
of the Isle of France, the Orleannais, and Anjou, it was admitted that
&lsquo;the wines of Ay do, for the most part, hold the first and principal
place, ... and are, in all good and evil years, found better than any
others.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The kings and princes of the day made the wines of Ay
their ordinary drink.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> They flowed freely in the scandalous orgies
with which the French Heliogabalus and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mignons</i> alternated their
pious flagellations and solemn processions, and mantled in the beakers
over which the chiefs of the League sat in dark and solemn conclave;
they were quaffed by the Béarnais to the bright eyes of the fair De
Saulve, and cheered the nightly vigils of Catherine de Medicis and Ruggieri;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
they sharpened the biting wit of Chicot, and spurred the
plotting spirit of Francis of Anjou. Guise and Crillon, Joyeuse and
D&rsquo;Epernon, Mayenne and D&rsquo;Aubigné made common cause in recognising their
merits; Quelus and Maugiron may have quaffed a goblet before setting
forth on their fatal journey to the Barrière Saint Antoine; and a cup,
filled by the fair hands of the Duchess de Montpensier, may have fired
the brain and nerved the arm of the regicide Jacques Clément.</p>

is a quaint old timber house traditionally known as the &lsquo;vendangeoir
d&rsquo;Henri Quatre,&rsquo; with obliterated carved escutcheons on the pillars of
its doorway. In this dilapidated yet interesting structure we have a
mute but certain testimony to the King&rsquo;s appreciation of the wine of Ay,
if not a confirmation of the truth of the assertion that Henri was as
proud of his title of Seigneur d&rsquo;Ay as of that of King of France.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>

The anonymous author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hercule Guepin</cite>, a poem penned at the
commencement of the seventeenth century in honour of the wine of
Orleans, is forced to acknowledge the merits of that of Ay;<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> and
that indefatigable commentator, the Abbé de Marolles, in a note to his
edition of Martial, classes the growths of Ay, Avenay, and Epernay
amongst the best that France produced. &lsquo;Vive le bon vin d&rsquo;Ay!&rsquo; exclaims
Guy Patin enthusiastically; and that strange compound of the wit and
the philosopher, St. Evremond, has extolled its qualities in prose and
verse.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> &lsquo;If you ask me which wine of all others I prefer,&rsquo; he writes
from London to the Count d&rsquo;Olonne, about 1671, &lsquo;without yielding to
tastes introduced by people of sham daintiness, I will answer that good
wine of Ay is the most natural of all wines, the most healthy, the best
purified from all earth smack; of a most exquisite charm, through the
peach flavour which is peculiar to it; and is, in my opinion, the finest
of all flavours.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>It is improbable that the wine of Ay of Francis I., or of Henri Quatre,
was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>, for had it been so history would have mentioned it. In
good years the still wine of Ay has a bouquet and perfume sufficient to
account for its ancient reputation. Neither was the wine St. Evremond
preferred sparkling, though his reference to the taste introduced by
sham <em>gourmets</em> points probably to the custom of drinking the wine
before its fermentation was completed, or else to the practice of icing
it. When once, however, the introduction of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> added a new
charm to the pleasures of the table, the poets who sang the praises
of the foaming nectar seem one and all to have celebrated it as the
&lsquo;pétillant Ay,&rsquo; and to have chosen, perhaps for euphonistic reasons,
that spot as its birthplace.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The material results were equally
satisfactory; for Arthur Young mentions that when, on July 8, 1787, he
visited &lsquo;Ay, a village not far out on the road to Reims very famous for
its wines,&rsquo; he was provided with a letter for M. Lasnier, who had 60,000
bottles in his cellar, whilst M. Dorsé had from 30,000 to 40,000.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>A century ago the foregoing were no doubt considered large stocks, but
to-day the very smallest of the Ay firms would think itself poorly
provided if its cellars contained under quadruple this quantity. The
largest Champagne establishment at Ay is that of Messrs. Deutz &amp;
Geldermann, whose extra dry &lsquo;Gold Lack&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cabinet&rsquo; Champagnes have
long been favourably known in England, through the energetic exertions
of their agents, Messrs. J. R. Parkington &amp; Co., of Crutched Friars.
The Ay firm have their offices in a massive-looking corner-house at
the further extremity of the town, in the direction of the steep hills
sheltering it on the north. This forms their central establishment,
and here are spacious celliers for disgorging and finishing off the
wine, a large packing-hall, and rooms where bales of corks and other
accessories of the trade are stored, the operations of making the cuvées
and bottling being accomplished in an establishment some little distance
off.</p>

<p>On proceeding thither, we find an elegant château with a charming
terraced garden, lying at the very foot of the vine-clad slopes, and on
the opposite side of the road some large celliers where wine in wood is
stored, and where the cuvées of the firm, consisting usually of upwards
of 50,000 gallons each, are made in a vat of gigantic proportions,
furnished with a raised platform at one end for the accommodation of the
workman who agitates the customary paddles. When the wine is completely
blended it is drawn off into casks disposed for the purpose in the
cellar below, as shown in the accompanying engraving, and after being
fined it rests for about a month to clear itself. To each of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
these casks of newly-blended wine a portion of old wine is added separately,
and at the moment of bottling the whole is newly amalgamated.</p>

<p class="caption">DRAWING OFF THE CUVÉE AT DEUTZ AND GELDERMANN&rsquo;S, AY.</p>
</div>

<p>Adjoining M. Deutz&rsquo;s château is the principal entrance to the extensive
cellars of the firm, to which, at our visit in 1877, considerable
additions were being made. In excavating these cellars in the chalk a
uniform system is pursued. The workmen commence by rounding off the
roof of the gallery, and then proceed to work gradually downwards,
extracting the chalk, whenever practicable, in blocks suitable for
building purposes, which, being worth from three to four shillings the
square yard, help to reduce the cost of the excavation. When any serious
flaws present themselves in the sides or roof of the galleries, they are
invariably made good with masonry.</p>

<p>This splendid range of cellars now comprises eight long and lofty
galleries no less than seventeen feet wide, and the same number of feet
in height, and of the aggregate length of 2200 yards. These spacious
vaults, which run parallel with each other, and communicate by means of
cross passages, underlie the street, the château, the garden, and the
vineyard slopes beyond, and possess the great advantage of being always
dry. They are capable, we were informed, of containing several million
bottles of Champagne, in addition to a large quantity of wine in cask.</p>

<p>Messrs. Deutz &amp; Geldermann possess vineyards at Ay, and own a large
vendangeoir at Verzenay, where in good years they usually press 500
pièces of wine. They, moreover, make large purchases of grapes at Bouzy,
Cramant, Le Mesnil, Pierry, &amp;c., and invariably have these pressed
under their own superintendence. Beyond large shipments to England,
where their wine is deservedly held in high estimation, Messrs. Deutz &amp;
Geldermann transact a considerable business with other countries, and
more especially with Germany, in which country their brand has been
for years one of the most popular, while to-day it is the favourite at
numerous regimental messes and the principal hotels.</p>

<p>Within a hundred yards of the open space, surrounded by houses of
different epochs and considerable diversity of design, where the Ay
market-hall stands, and in one of those narrow winding streets common to
the town, an escutcheon, with a bunch of grapes for device, surmounting
a lofty gateway, attracts attention. Beyond, a trim courtyard, girt
round with orange-trees in bright green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
boxes, and clipped in orthodox
fashion, affords access to the handsome residence and offices of M.
Duminy, well known in England and America as a shipper of high-class
Champagnes, and whose Parisian connection is extensive. On the
right-hand side of the courtyard is the packing-room; and through the
cellars, which have an entrance here, one can reach the celliers in an
adjoining street, where the cuvée is made and the bottling of the wine
accomplished.</p>

</div>

<p>M. Duminy&rsquo;s cellars are remarkably old, and consequently of somewhat
irregular construction, being at times rather low and narrow, as well as
on different levels. In addition, however, to these venerable vaults,
packed with wines of 1874 and &rsquo;78, M. Duminy has a new and extensive
establishment on the outskirts of Ay, as well as various subterranean
adjuncts in the town itself. This new establishment, which stands under
the vineclad slope, and merely a stone&rsquo;s throw from the railway line to
Reims, consists of a large ornamental building looking on to a spacious
courtyard ordinarily alive with busy workpeople. In addition to the
pavilion already erected, it is intended to construct one of similar
design, and to connect the two with a monumental tower. The requisite
land has already been purchased, the architectural plans are prepared,
and the work is now in active progress.</p>

<p>Entering the courtyard of which we have spoken, we notice the new
offices of the firm on the left hand, and extending along the wall
beyond is a long zinc-roofed shed, crowded with baskets filled with
newly-purchased Champagne bottles. On the opposite side of the courtyard
is a building in which the operation of bottle-washing is carried on.
The pavilion in the rear of the courtyard is of somewhat monumental
proportions, and is ornamented with dressings of white stone and red
brick. Entering through the principal doorway, we find ourselves in a
vast cellier, where the packing operations are carried on, and where are
a couple of huge tuns in which the cuvées of the house are made. A stone
staircase conducts to an upper cellier, where several hundred casks of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> are stored, and for the raising or lowering of which lifts
are provided at stated distances. In an apartment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
above this second
cellier straw envelopes for bottles and other accessories employed in
the trade are kept.</p>

<p class="caption">M. DUMINY&rsquo;S NEW ESTABLISHMENT AT AY.</p>
</div>

<p>The cellars extend, not merely beneath this large building and the
courtyard in front, but run under the adjacent mountain-slope. They
comprise four galleries on the same level, vaulted and faced with brick
or stone, each gallery being about 500 feet in length and upwards of
twelve feet in width and height. Eight transverse passages connect
these galleries with each other, and numerous lifts communicate with
the cellier and the courtyard above. The galleries that run under
the vineyard slope are ventilated by shafts no less than 120 feet in
height. M. Duminy has already provided room here for a million bottles
of sparkling wine; and it is estimated that, when the establishment
is completed, two and a half millions of bottles can be stored here
in addition to the stock contained in the old cellars possessed by M.
Duminy in the town. During its two-thirds of a century of existence
the house has invariably confined itself to first-class wines, taking
particular pride in shipping fully-matured growths. Besides its own
large reserve of these, it holds considerable stocks long since disposed
of, and now merely awaiting the purchasers&rsquo; orders to be shipped.</p>

<p>A few paces beyond M. Duminy&rsquo;s we come upon an antiquated,
decrepit-looking timber house, with its ancient gable bulging over as
though the tough oak brackets on which it rests were at last grown
weary of supporting their unwieldy burden. Judging from the quaint
carved devices on the timbers at the lower portions of this building,
one may imagine it to have been the residence of an individual of some
importance in the days when the principal European potentates had their
commissioners installed at Ay to secure them the finest vintages. The
house evidently dates back to this or to an earlier epoch.</p>

<p>The cellars of Messrs. Pfungst Frères et Cie. are situated some little
distance from the vineyard owned by them at Ay. The firm lay themselves
out exclusively for the shipment of high-class Champagne, and the
excellent growths of this district necessarily form an important element
in their carefully-composed cuvées. A considerable portion of their
stock consists of reserves of old wine of grand years; and a variety of
samples of finely-matured Champagnes were submitted to our judgment.
All of these wines were of superior quality, combining delicacy and
fragrance with dryness, the latter being their especial feature. In
addition to their business with England, where the brand of the firm is
rapidly increasing in popularity among connoisseurs of matured wines,
Messrs. Pfungst Frères ship largely to India and the United States.</p>

<p class="caption">CAPITALS AND MOULDINGS IN AY CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>On the northern side of the town stands the handsome Gothic church
of Ay, dating from about the middle of the fifteenth century. The
existing building replaced the edifice erected some two hundred years
previously, and traces of which are still to be seen in the present
transept. The stone tower, which is in striking contrast with the other
portions of the structure, bears the date 1541 on its western face.
This tower and the interior of the church were greatly damaged by
the fire&mdash;traditionally ascribed to lightning&mdash;which occurred at the
close of the sixteenth century, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the former had to be strengthened
by filling up the arched windows and by the addition of buttresses.
The bell, whose terrible tocsin used to warn good citizens that the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patrie</i> was in danger in the days of the Revolution, when the church
was converted into a Temple of Reason, had previously swung in the abbey
of Hautvillers, and may have summoned the vintagers to labour as well
as the faithful to prayer. From 1867 to 1877 extensive interior repairs
and restorations, costing upwards of 6000&thinsp;<i>l.</i>, greatly transformed
the interior of the church. Care was, however, taken to preserve the
numerous bits of mediæval and Renaissance sculpture with which both
the interior and exterior of the edifice were studded. In many of
the ornamental mouldings, as well as the capitals of the columns,
grape-laden vine-branches had been freely introduced, as if to indicate
the honour in which the vine, the material source of all the prosperity
enjoyed by the little town, was held both by mediæval and later
architects; and these appear all to have been scrupulously restored.
One of the most characteristic decorations of this character is the
sculptured figure of a boy bearing a basket of grapes upon his head,
which surmounts the handsome Renaissance doorway.</p>

<p class="caption">MOULDINGS FROM AY CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>Within half an hour&rsquo;s walk of Ay, in an easterly direction, is the
village of Mareuil, a long straight street of straggling houses, bounded
by trees and garden-plots, with vine-clad hills rising abruptly behind
on the one side, and the Marne canal flowing placidly by on the other.
The archaic church, a mixture of the Romanesque and Early Gothic, stands
at the farther end of the village, and some little distance on this
side of it is a massive-looking eighteenth-century building, spacious
enough to accommodate a regiment of horse, but conventual rather than
barrack-like in aspect, from the paucity of windows looking on to the
road. A broad gateway leads into a spacious courtyard, to the left of
which stands a grand château; while on the right there rises an ornate
round tower of three stories, from the gallery on the summit of which
a fine view over the valley of the Marne is obtained. The buildings,
enclosing the court on three sides, comprise press-houses, celliers,
and packing-rooms, an antiquated sun-dial marking the hour on the blank
space above the vines that climb beside the entrance gateway. The more
ancient of these tenements formed the vendangeoir of the Dukes of
Orleans at the time they owned the château of Mareuil, purchased in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
1830 by the Duke de Montebello, son of the famous Marshal Lannes, and
minister and ambassador of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III.</p>

<p>The acquisition of this property, to which were attached some
important vineyards, led, several years later, to the duke&rsquo;s founding,
in conjunction with his brothers, the Marquis and General Count de
Montebello, a Champagne firm, whose brand speedily acquired a notable
popularity. To-day the business is carried on by their sons and heirs,
for all the original partners in the house have followed their valiant
father to the grave. Struck down by an Austrian cannon-ball in the
zenith of his fame, the career of Marshal Lannes, brief as it was,
furnishes one of the most brilliant pages in French military annals.
Joining the army of Italy as a volunteer in 1796, he was made a colonel
on the battle-field in the gorges of Millesimo, when Augereau&rsquo;s bold
advance opened Piedmont to the French. He fought at Bassano and Lodi,
took part in the assault of Pavia and the siege of Mantua, and at
Arcola, when Napoleon dashed flag in hand upon the bridge, Lannes
was seriously wounded whilst shielding his general from danger. He
afterwards distinguished himself in Egypt, and led the van of the
French army across the Alps, displaying his accustomed bravery both at
Montebello and Marengo. At Austerlitz, where he commanded the right
wing of the army, he greatly contributed to the victory; and at Jena,
Friedland, and Eylau his valour was again conspicuous. Sent to Spain,
he defeated the Spaniards at Tudela, and took part in the operations
against Saragossa. Wounded at the battle of Essling, when the Archduke
Charles inflicted upon Napoleon I. the first serious repulse he had
met with on the field of battle, the valiant Lannes expired a few days
afterwards in the Emperor&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MONTEBELLO ESTABLISHMENT AT MAREUIL.</p>
</div>

<p>We were met at Mareuil, on the occasion of our visit, by Count Alfred
Ferdinand de Montebello, the present manager of the house, and conducted
by him over the establishment. In the press-house, to the left of the
courtyard, were two of the ponderous presses used in the Champagne, for,
like all other large firms, the house makes its own wine. Grapes grown
in the Mareuil vineyards arrive here in baskets slung over the backs of
mules, muzzled, so that while awaiting their loads they may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
not devour
the fruit within reach. In a cellier adjoining the press-house stands a
large vat, capable of holding fifty pièces of wine, with a crane beside
it for hauling up the casks when the cuvée is made. Here the tirage
likewise takes place; and in the range of buildings roofed with glass,
in the rear of the tower, the bottled wine is labelled, capped with
foil, and packed in cases for transmission to Paris, England, and other
places abroad.</p>

<p>A double flight of steps, decorated with lamps and vases, leads to
the handsome offices of the firm, situated on the first-floor of the
tower; while above is an apartment with a panelled ceiling, gracefully
decorated with groups of Cupids engaged in the vintage and the various
operations which the famous wines of the Mountain and the River undergo
during their conversion into Champagne. On the ground-floor of the tower
a low doorway conducts to the spacious cellars, which, owing to the
proximity of the Marne, are all on the same level as well as constructed
in masonry. The older vaults, where the Marquis de Pange, a former owner
of the château, stored the wine which he used to sell to the Champagne
manufacturers, are somewhat low and tortuous compared with the broad and
lofty galleries of more recent date, which have been constructed as the
growing connection of the firm obliged them to increase their stocks.
Spite, however, of numerous additions, portions of their reserves have
to be stored in other cellars in Mareuil. Considerable stocks of each of
the four qualities of wine supplied by the firm are being got ready for
disgorgement, including Cartes Noires and Bleues, with the refined Carte
Blanche and the delicate Crêmant, which challenge comparison with brands
of the highest repute.</p>

Lannes&rsquo;s gold-embroidered velvet saddle trappings, his portrait and

<p class="drop-cap p2">A<span class="smaller">VIZE</span>, situated in the heart of the Champagne white grape district,
may be reached from Epernay by road through Pierry and Cramant, or
by the Châlons Railway to Oiry Junction, between which station and
Romilly there runs a local line, jocularly termed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chemin de fer
de famille</i>, from the general disregard displayed by the officials for
anything approaching to punctuality. Avize can scarcely be styled a
town, and yet its growing proportions are beyond those of an ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
village. It lies pleasantly nestled among the vines, sheltered by bold
ridges on the north-west, with the monotonous plains of La Champagne
pouilleuse, unsuited to the cultivation of the vine, stretching away
eastward in the direction of Châlons. Avize cannot pretend to the same
antiquity as its neighbour Vertus, and lacks the many picturesque
vestiges of which the latter can boast. Its church dates back only to
the fifteenth century, although the principal doorway in the Romanesque
style evidently belongs to a much earlier epoch. There is a general
air of trim prosperity about the place, and the villagers have that
well-to-do appearance common to the inhabitants of the French wine
districts. Only at vintage-time, however, are there any particular
outdoor signs of activity, although half a score of Champagne firms
have their establishments here, giving employment to the bulk of the
population, and sending forth their two or three million bottles of the
sparkling wine of the Marne annually.</p>

<p>Proceeding along the straight level road leading from the station to the
village, we encounter on our right hand the premises of Messrs. Giesler
&amp; Co., the reputation of whose brand is universal. When M. Giesler
quitted the firm of P. A. Mumm, Giesler, &amp; Co., at Reims, in 1838, he
removed to Avize, and founded the present extensive establishment.
Entering through a large open gateway, we find ourselves within a
spacious courtyard, with a handsome dwelling-house in the rear, and
all the signs of a Champagne business of magnitude apparent. A spiral
staircase conducts to the counting-house on the first story of a range
of buildings on the left hand, the ground floor of which is divided
into celliers. Passing through a door by the side of this staircase, we
enter a large hall where the operation of bottling the wine is going on.
Four tuns, each holding five ordinary pièces of wine, and raised upon
large blocks of wood, are standing here, and communicating with them
are bottling syphons of the type commonly employed in the Champagne.
Messrs. Giesler do not usually consign the newly-bottled wine at once to
the cellars, but retain it above-ground for about a fortnight, in order
that it may develop its effervescent qualities more perfectly. We find
many thousands of these bottles stacked horizontally in the adjoining
celliers, in one of which stands the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
great cuvée tun, wherein some
fifty hogsheads of the finest Champagne growths are blended together
at one time, two hundred hogsheads being thus mingled daily while the
cuvées are in progress. The casks of wine having been hoisted from the
cellars to the first floor by a crane, and run on to a trough, their
bungs are removed, and the wine flows through an aperture in the floor
into the huge tun beneath, its amalgamation being accomplished by the
customary fan-shaped appliances, set in motion by the turning of a
wheel. In an adjacent room is the machine used for mixing the liqueur
which Messrs. Giesler add so sparingly to their light and fragrant wines.</p>

<p class="caption">MAKING THE CUVÉE AT MESSRS. GIESLER&rsquo;S, AT AVIZE.</p>
</div>

<p>There are a couple of floors above these celliers, the uppermost
of which is used as a general store, while in the one beneath many
thousands of bottles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> repose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur pointe</i>, either in racks
or on tables, as at the Clicquot-Werlé establishment. This latter
system requires ample space, for as the workman who shakes the bottles
is only able to use one hand, the operation of dislodging the sediment
necessarily occupies a much longer time than is requisite when the
bottles rest in racks.</p>

<p>The buildings on the opposite side of the courtyard comprise a
large packing-hall, celliers where the wine is finished off, and
rooms where corks and suchlike things are stored. Here, too, is the
entrance to the cellars, of which there are three tiers, all lofty
and well-ventilated galleries, very regular in their construction,
and faced with either stone or brick. In these extensive vaults are
casks of fine reserved wines for blending with youthful vintages,
and bottles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i>, built up in solid stacks, that may be
reckoned by their hundreds of thousands. At Messrs. Giesler&rsquo;s the
disgorging of the wine is accomplished in a small cellier partially
underground, and the temperature of which is very cool and equable. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgeurs</i>, isolated from the rest of the workpeople, are carrying
on their operations here by candlelight. So soon as the sediment is
removed, the bottles are raised in baskets to the cellier above, where
the liqueuring, recorking, stringing, and wiring are successively
accomplished. By pursuing this plan the loss sustained by the
disgorgement is believed to be reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Extensive as these premises are, they are still insufficient for the
requirements of the firm; and across the road is a spacious building
where new bottles are stored, and the washing of the bottles in
preparation for the tirage takes place. By the aid of the machinery
provided sixteen women, assisted by a couple of men, commonly wash some
fifteen or sixteen thousand bottles in the course of a day. Here, too,
stands one of the two large presses with which, at the epoch of the
vintage, a hundred pièces of wine are pressed every four-and-twenty
hours. The remaining press is installed in a cellier at the farther end
of the garden on the other side of the road. Messrs. Giesler possess
additional presses at their vendangeoir at Bouzy, and during the vintage
have the command of presses at Ay, Verzenay, Vertus, Le Mesnil, &amp;c.; it
being a rule of theirs always to press the grapes within a few hours
after they are gathered, to obviate their becoming bruised by their own
weight and imparting a dark colour to the wine, a contingency difficult
to guard against in seasons when the fruit is over-ripe. The firm own
vineyards at Avize, and have agreements with vine-proprietors at Ay,
Bouzy, Verzenay, and elsewhere, to purchase their crops regularly every
year. Messrs. Giesler&rsquo;s brand has secured its existing high repute
solely through the fine quality of the wines shipped by the house&mdash;wines
which are known and appreciated by all real connoisseurs of Champagne.</p>

<p>From Messrs. Giesler&rsquo;s it is merely a short walk to the establishment
of M. Charles de Cazanove, situated in the principal street of Avize.
On entering the court we encountered a tame young boar engaged in
the lively pursuit of chasing some terrified hens; while a trio
of boar-hounds, basking on the sunny flagstones, contemplated his
proceedings with lazy indifference. Boars abound in the woods
hereabouts, and hunting them is a favourite pastime with the residents;
and the young boar we had noticed proved to be one of the recent
captures of the sons of M. de Cazanove, who are among the warmest
partisans of the exciting sport.</p>

<p>The house of M. Charles de Cazanove was established in 1843, by its
present proprietor, on the foundation of a business which had been in
existence since 1811. Compared with the monumental grandeur of some
of the great Reims and Epernay establishments, the premises present
a simple and modest aspect; nevertheless, they are capacious and
commodious, besides which, the growing business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of the house has led
to the acquisition of additional cellarage in other parts of Avize.
More important than all, however, is the quality of the wine with which
these cellars are stocked; and, following the rule observed by Champagne
firms of the highest repute, it has been a leading principle with M. de
Cazanove always to rely upon the choicer growths&mdash;those light, delicate,
and fragrant wines of the Marne which throw out the true aroma of
the flower of the vine. M. de Cazanove, who is distinguished for his
knowledge of viticulture, occupies an influential position at Avize,
being Vice-President of the Horticultural Society of the Marne, and a
member of the committee charged with guarding the Champagne vineyards
against the invasion of the phylloxera. His own vines include only
those fine varieties to which the crus of the Marne owe their great
renown. He possesses an excellent vineyard at Grauves, near Avize; and
his mother-in-law, Madame Poultier of Pierry, is one of the principal
vine-growers of the district.</p>

<p>M. de Cazanove&rsquo;s wines are much appreciated in Paris, where his business
is very extensive. His shipments to England are also considerable; but
from the circumstance of some of his principal customers importing the
wine under special brands of their own, the brand of the house is not so
widely known as we should have anticipated.</p>

<p class="caption">VINEYARDS OF AVIZE AND CRAMANT, FROM THE GARDEN OF M. C.
DE CAZANOVE.</p>
</div>

<p>From M. de Cazanove&rsquo;s terraced garden in the rear of his establishment a
fine view is obtained of one of the most famous viticultural districts
of the Champagne, yielding wines of remarkable delicacy and exquisite
bouquet. On the left hand rises up the mountain of Avize, its summit
fringed with dense woods, where in winter the wild-boar has his lair.
In front stretch the long vine-clad slopes of Cramant, with orchards
at their base, and the housetops of the village and the spire of the
quaint old church just peeping over the brow of the hill. To the right
towers the bold forest-crowned height of Saran, with M. Moët&rsquo;s château
perched half-way up its north-eastern slope; and fading away in the hazy
distance are the monotonous plains of the Champagne.</p>

<p>We have already explained that the wines of Avize and Cramant rank as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premiers crus</i> of the white grape district, and that every Champagne
manufacturer of repute mingles one or the other in his cuvée. The white
grapes are usually gathered a fortnight or three weeks later than the black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
varieties, but in other respects the vintaging of them is
the same. The grapes undergo the customary minute examination by the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éplucheuses</i>, and all unripe, damaged, and rotten berries being thrown
aside, the fruit is conveyed with due care to the press-houses in the
large baskets known as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paniers mannequins</i>. The pressing takes place
under exactly the same conditions as the pressing of the black grapes;
the must, too, is drawn off into hogsheads to ferment, and by the end
of the year, when the active fermentation has terminated, the wine is
usually clear and limpid.</p>

<p>At Rilly-la-Montagne, on the line of railway between Reims and Epernay,
Roper Frères &amp; Cie., late of Epernay, have their establishment. Starting
from the latter place, we pass Ay and Avenay, and then the little
village of Germaine in the midst of the forest, and nigh the summit of
the mountain of Reims, with its &lsquo;Rendezvous des Chasseurs&rsquo; in immediate
proximity to the station. Finally we arrive at Rilly, which, spite of
its isolated situation, has about it that aspect of prosperity common
to the more favourable wine districts of France. This is scarcely
surprising, when the quality of its wines is taken into consideration.
The still red wine of Rilly has long enjoyed a high local reputation,
and to-day the Rilly growths are much sought after for conversion
into Champagne. White wine of 1874, from black grapes, fetched, we
are informed, as much as 600 to 700 francs the pièce; while the finer
qualities from white grapes realised from 300 to 400 francs. Messrs.
Roper Frères &amp; Cie. are the owners of some productive vineyards situated
on the high-road to Chigny and Ludes.</p>

<p>The establishment of Roper Frères is adjacent to a handsome modern house
standing back from the road in a large and pleasant garden, bounded by
vineyards on two of its sides. In the celliers all the conveniences
pertaining to a modern Champagne establishment are to be found, while
extending beneath the garden are the extensive cellars of the firm,
comprising two stories of long and spacious galleries excavated in the
chalk, their walls and roofs being supported whenever necessary by
masonry. A curious feature about these cellars is that the roots of the
larger trees in the garden above have penetrated the roof of the upper
story, and hang pendent overhead like innumerable stalactites. Here,
after the comparatively new wine of 1874 had been shown to us&mdash;including
samples of the vin brut or natural Champagne of which the firm make a
specialty at a moderate price&mdash;some choice old Champagnes were brought
forth, including the fine vintages of 1865, 1857, and 1846. The latter
wine had of course preserved very little of its effervescence, still its
flavour was exceedingly fine, being soft and delicate to a degree. At
the Vienna Exhibition of 1873, and the London Exhibition of 1874, the
collection of Champagnes exhibited by Roper Frères met with favourable
recognition from the international juries.</p>

<p class="bottom2">Our tour through the Champagne vineyards and wine-cellars here comes
to an end. It is true there are important establishments at Châlons,
notably those of the Perriers, Freminet et Fils, Dagonet et Fils, and
Jacquard Frères. As, however, any description of these would be little
else than a recapitulation of something we have already said, we content
ourselves with merely notifying their existence, and close the present
chapter with a poem on Champagne, from the pen of M. Amaury de Cazanove
of Avize:</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> Champagne does not merely comprise vineyards producing some of the
finest wine in the world. In parts it is covered by vast and luxuriant
forests, where the pleasures of the chase are not lacking to the
Champenois, who as a rule are eager in the pursuit of sport. In winter
these forests are the resort of wild-boar, who haunt by preference the
woods around Reims, journeying thither, it is said, by night from the
famous forest of the Ardennes&mdash;the scene of Rosalind&rsquo;s wanderings and
Touchstone&rsquo;s eccentricities, as set forth in <cite>As You Like It</cite>; and whose
gloomy depths and tangled glens shelter not merely boars, but wolves as
well.</p>

<p>In the villages of the Champagne on a cold winter&rsquo;s morning, with
it snowing or blowing, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
are frequently awake before daylight by
the noise of barking dogs, of horns sounding the departure, and of
some vehicle rolling heavily over the stones. A party of sportsmen
is proceeding to the meet. Jokes and laughter enliven the journey,
but every one becomes silent and serious upon reaching the place of
rendezvous, for the object of the gathering is the excitable and
perilous boar-hunt.</p>

<p>In the Champagne it is no longer the fashion, as in Burgundy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;With javelin&rsquo;s point a churlish swine to gore.&rsquo;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The more certain rifle is the weapon usually employed, and these arms
are now examined and carefully loaded. Meanwhile the reports of the
keepers are attentively listened to. They have beaten the wood, each
on his own side, accompanied by a bloodhound, and they inform the
hunters what they have seen or found. Great experience is necessary to
accomplish the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rembuchement</i>, as this tour of inspection is termed,
in a satisfactory manner; and with some it is a veritable science.
Eventually, after a discussion among the more experienced ones, it is
decided to follow the scent which appears to be freshest; whereupon
the dogs are brought up coupled, and let loose upon the trail. The
attack now begins. There are always two or three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueurs</i> who follow
the dogs, exciting them with their voices, and making all the noise
possible, as long as the game has not been roused from its lair.
Meanwhile the marksmen place themselves at the posts indicated by the
president of the hunt, the most experienced being assigned the best
spots, whilst those whose habit it is never to harm the boar go of their
own accord &lsquo;up wind&rsquo;&mdash;that is, to bad places&mdash;thus causing the animal to
&lsquo;refuse,&rsquo; and to pass within range of guns that rarely let him escape
unhurt.</p>

<p>At first the dogs raise a somewhat distant cry&mdash;perhaps one has followed
a wrong scent&mdash;and some of the huntsmen remark in a low tone to
themselves that after all they would have done better to have stopped at
home, and turned out of their beds at a less unseasonable hour; then,
at least, they would not be standing with frozen feet in the snow, and
with colds in the head in perspective. But suddenly there comes a cry of
&lsquo;Vlô!&rsquo;&mdash;the Champenois expression for designating the boar&mdash;&lsquo;Attention!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Look out!&rsquo; Then the report of a couple of shots, and finally the
howling of the pack of dogs. Snow and cold are at once forgotten. Each
man grasps his rifle and waits for the boar to pass by. The branches
of the underwood creak and break; there is a noise as of a squadron of
cavalry dashing into a wood; then, all of a sudden, a black mass is
caught sight of approaching. But the boar is a cunning fellow; he has
seen the sportsman who is in wait for him, or has scented his presence,
and will pass out of range. Now that luck has betrayed the latter, he
has to content himself with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of a spectator.</p>

<p>So far as one can judge by the barking of the dogs, the boar is
directing his course to where an experienced marksman is posted&mdash;one
who is not about to fire his first difficult shot. Observe him: he is
perfectly motionless, for the least movement might betray his presence;
his eyes alone dart right and left in quest of the foe. Here comes the
boar, passing like a cannon-ball along the line, and there is scarcely
time to catch a glimpse of him between the reports of two shots, which
succeed each other with the rapidity of lightning. The boar is by no
means an animal easy to knock over. The forest roads are never more
than ten to fifteen paces broad; and as there are marksmen both on the
right and left, it is necessary to reserve your fire until the animal
has crossed the road and is plunging again into cover. In addition to
this, there are only two spots where a mortal wound can be inflicted
upon the boar&mdash;either behind the shoulder or in the neck. Hit elsewhere,
he will lose but little blood, and the only effect of the wound will be
to render him more savage. He will rip up a dog or two, perhaps, and
then rush off far away, without showing any further sign of injury.
Boars carrying several bullets in their bodies, but rejoicing in capital
health, as well as others covered with cicatrices, are frequently
killed. Firing too high is a common fault with many marksmen, arising
from the fact that in winter the boar&rsquo;s bristles are very long and
thick, and that each one stands on end at the sight of an enemy, thus
making the animal look much higher on his legs than he really is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>But to return to our description of the hunt. The boar has just been
hit by one of those rare marksmen, every bullet of whose rifle goes
straight to its intended billet. Although struck, the animal continues
his onward course, a couple of drops of blood which have tinged the
snow with red showing unmistakably that he has not been missed. The
dogs who follow him closely hesitate for a minute as they reach the
roadway, but the leader has espied the spot where the boar was wounded;
he sniffs the blood, and darts off again, followed by the pack, who
have full confidence in his discernment. The dogs are torn and wounded
by the thorns and briers which continually obstruct their path, for the
boar rushes through the thickest and most inaccessible cover, in hopes
of retarding the progress of his pursuers; but the hounds divine that
their prey is near, and the most tired among them recover all their
energy. Suddenly a great silence succeeds the furious yelping and baying
of a short time ago. The boar is about to turn at bay. His strength is
becoming exhausted, and feeling that he is doomed to die, he has faced
round, with his back towards some inaccessible thicket, so as not to be
taken in the rear, and confronts his pursuers, determined to die bravely
and to sell his life dearly. It is no longer the baying of a pack in
full cry that now rends the air, but isolated yelpings and plaintive
howlings, such as watch-dogs give vent to when strangers are wandering
round the house they protect.</p>

<p>Then comes the crowning feat of the hunt, and the most difficult to
accomplish. The most intrepid marksman advances towards the dogs, his
hunting-knife and rifle alike ready, the former to be made use of should
the latter not suffice. He has need of great prudence and great coolness
to accomplish his task, for directly the boar hears his approach he will
unhesitatingly dash upon him. He must await the animal&rsquo;s onslaught with
a firm heart and steady hand, and only fire when sure of his aim. Often,
however, the hunter is bothered by the dogs, which surround the boar on
all sides, hang on to him from behind, and excite his fury. The position
may become critical, and many a sportsman who has counted too much upon
his nerve has found himself compelled to climb a tree, whence he has
been able to &lsquo;bowl over&rsquo; the enemy, without incurring any danger. It is
needless to add that when discovered in this position he has felt very
much ashamed at having resorted to such an expedient.</p>

<p>In the Champagne the wild boar is almost invariably pursued on foot, the
minute subdivision of the land into different holdings and consequent
limitation of the right of sport rendering it very difficult to follow
the animal on horseback. M. Roederer, it is true, started a pack
of hounds in the Forest of Reims; but at his death there were not
sufficient lovers of the chase to keep up this style of sport, and
every one fell into the habit of knocking over a wild-boar in the same
prosaic fashion as a simple rabbit. However, some few years back, a
rich landowner from Brittany, the Vicomte d&rsquo;Honnincton, having had an
opportunity of sport in the Champagne, and having seen that large game
abounded, installed himself near the fine Forêt de la Traconne, in the
neighbourhood of Sézanne, and resumed the chase of the wild-boar on
horseback. The great success he met with induced him to take up his
quarters in this district, and his pack, composed of a cross between the
English staghound and the Artois hound, has become justly famous.</p>

<p>In the month of December 1878, an exciting day&rsquo;s sport was had with M.
d&rsquo;Honnincton&rsquo;s boar-hounds. The presence of herds of wild-boar having
been noted in the neighbouring woods between Epernay and Montmort, M.
d&rsquo;Honnincton was soon to the fore with his pack, and all the sportsmen
for miles around were summoned. The meet was at the Château de la
Charmoye, a regular hunters&rsquo; rendezvous, belonging to the Vicomte de
Bouthylliers, and situate in the heart of the woodland. During breakfast
one of the huntsmen came to announce that a huge <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">solitaire</i> had passed
the night at a short distance from the château. Everything, therefore,
promised well for sport. The guests mounted in haste, each one equipped
in true French style, with an immense hunting-horn round his body and
a light gun or a pistol attached to the saddle. The lively strains of
the horn had begun to sound on every side, and the hounds were being
uncoupled, when the boar, disturbed by all this noise, majestically
traversed the main avenue of the château, and pushed on towards a group
of ladies assembled to witness the departure of the sportsmen. A finer
start would have been impossible.

as soon as they caught sight of him at full cry, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sonnerie du
sanglier</i> and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vue</i> were blazed forth by the horns on every side.
The hunt commenced. The greatest difficulty and the object of all was to
hinder the boar from plunging into the thick of the forest, where, in
the dense cover, he would have gained a considerable advance upon the
dogs. Thanks to the activity of the huntsmen, who cut off his retreat on
this side, it was possible to drive him towards the plain of Montmort;
and from this moment the sport was as fine as can be imagined, it being
easy to note the minor details of the hunt even from a distance. The
boar made his way with difficulty over the ground saturated by rain, and
the eagerness of the hounds increased in proportion as they gained upon
him.</p>

<p>A broadish rivulet with very steep banks was reached. The boar tried to
clear it at a bound, but fell into mid-stream. The sportsmen all came up
at this moment, and with their horns began to sound in chorus &lsquo;The boar
has taken soil;&rsquo; the hounds plunged in and began to swim after the boar,
and the scene became a truly exciting one. At length the boar succeeded
in quitting the stream; but frightened by the horsemen whom he saw on
the opposite shore, he recrossed it a second and then a third time,
amidst the hounds, who were assailing him on every side, and each time
met with the same difficulty in ascending the bank. It may be readily
understood that he was getting exhausted by his efforts, and began
to appear done up. He recovered his vigour, however, and soon gained
ground on the hounds. He had still two or three miles to cover in order
to regain the forest, and it was necessary at all costs to prevent him
from accomplishing this. Then ensued a wild hunt, a mad steeplechase
over fields, hedges, brooks, ditches; the horses in several places sank
over their hocks, and were covered with foam, but whip and spur restored
energy to the least ardent. The boar was gasping, but still kept on,
and the steam from his body, which quite surrounded him and caused him
to resemble a four-legged demon, could be plainly perceived from a
distance. In this style the hunt swept through the little village of
Lucy, with all the dogs of the place howling, the women and children
shrieking, and the men arming themselves with spades and pitchforks.
But the boar not losing courage on this account, and despising these
primitive weapons, did not stop, and drew nearer and nearer to the wood.
The hounds were getting tired, and the most experienced sportsmen began
to despair somewhat of a successful day, when suddenly the beast plunged
into a pond situate close to the forest, halted, rolled several times in
the mud, and rose completely covered in steam and mire. It is all over:
the animal is at bay, and cannot go any further.</p>

<p>This is the interesting moment. The boar pulls himself together, feeling
that he is to die, and, up to his belly in water, he bravely awaits the
pack. With his eye glowing with rage, his bristles erect, he utters
grunts of defiance. The fifty dogs throw themselves on to him without
a moment&rsquo;s hesitation; but four or five are sent rolling into the
middle of the water, never more to rise. The struggle which follows is
terrible; the boar&rsquo;s tusks tell at every blow, and the water becomes
literally red with blood. At length the foremost sportsmen come up, and
it is high time they do. Seven dogs are already lying on their backs,
with their legs in the air, and almost all bear marks of the boar&rsquo;s
terrible tusks. The first who is ready alights from his steed, and
boldly advances into the water; for it would be imprudent to fire at the
boar from the edge of the pond, and thereby run the risk of wounding
him, and rendering him still more furious, or even of killing one of the
dogs, by whom he is surrounded. An interval of solemn silence ensues;
the horns only wait for the shot to be fired to sound the <em>hallali</em>. The
dogs make way in order to let the sportsman advance; the boar draws back
a little, and then making a bound recovers all his strength for a rush
upon his enemy. Woe to the man who misses him! the boar will give him no
quarter. But the sportsman waits for him very quietly, and when he is
only two paces from him plants a bullet between his eyes, which lays him
dead. The notes of the <em>hallali</em> awake the echoes: never had a hunt been
crowned by finer results. The setting sun lighted up the scene, which
transpired just below the Château de Montmort, scarcely half a mile off,
and the ladies assembled on the terrace of the old château of Sully
waved their handkerchiefs in congratulation to the fortunate sportsmen.</p>

<p>The foregoing narrative furnishes a good idea of the ordinary method of
hunting the wild-boar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
on horseback in the Champagne, a method which,
though offering at times varying details, arising from the size of the
animal pursued and the number and strength of the hounds engaged in the
chase, presents, on the whole, a general resemblance to the description
just given.</p>

<p>Some years back boars were far from numerous in the Champagne, hiding
themselves, moreover, in inaccessible positions far away in the woods,
so that it was necessary to cover a larger extent of ground in order to
sight a recent trail. Latterly, however, these animals have multiplied
considerably, each sow having seven or eight young ones at a litter, and
littering three times a year. In the forests around Reims and Epernay
twelve, and even fifteen, boars have been killed during a single hunt.
It not unfrequently happens that a herd of fifty, and even a hundred,
boars are encountered together, when a veritable massacre often ensues,
if the hunting-party only comprises a sufficient number of guns.</p>

<p>The victims include at times some sows with young grice, which the
hunters frequently try to bring up. One of these little animals, who had
been named &lsquo;Snow&rsquo; from having been captured one day when the snow was on
the ground, followed his owner about everywhere like the most faithful
poodle. His master would often take him into the wood and simulate a
hunt with his dogs. Snow, however, possessed vices as well as virtues,
and one of his habits was an extremely disagreeable one. Like the rest
of his species, he was very fond of rolling himself in the mire, and, on
returning home, would proceed to clean himself by rubbing unconcernedly
against the dresses of the ladies of the house. One Sunday his master
had taken him out for a walk, and as they returned home they passed
the church, which the ladies of the locality, arrayed in their richest
attire, were just leaving. During his walk Snow had taken two or three
mud-baths, and, on meeting the fair devotees of Avize, he thought the
occasion a propitious one for cleansing himself. He at once put the idea
into practice, employing the silk dresses of the ladies for the purpose.
The children who accompanied them were greatly terrified, and rushed
shrieking into the adjoining houses, pursued by the gambolling boar,
who seemed to greatly enjoy the panic he had caused. As La Fontaine has
remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">&lsquo;Rien que la mort n&rsquo;était capable</div>
      <div class="verse">D&rsquo;expier son forfait.&rsquo;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So, after such an offence, poor Snow was sentenced to undergo capital
punishment, and expiated by death his want of regard for the silk attire
of the fair sex.</p>

<p>Another boar named &lsquo;Scotsman,&rsquo; and belonging to the same sportsman, was
also an amusing fellow. He would stretch himself out in the sun of an
afternoon as majestically as the Sultan on his divan, whilst a hen with
whom he had contracted a tender friendship kindly relieved him of his
parasites.</p>

<p>A gentleman of the same district owns two enormous sows, which follow
him like greyhounds whenever he rides out. When a friend asks him to
step indoors and to refresh or rest himself, he replies: &lsquo;I must beg
you to excuse me; I have with me <cite>Catherine</cite> and <cite>Rigolette</cite>, who might
inconvenience you.&rsquo; The friend looks round to see who these interesting
young people may be, and his surprise may be imagined when two big swine
familiarly place their forepaws upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>Several sportsmen of the Champagne possess packs of hounds, and the
true boar-hound, the &lsquo;dog of black St. Hubert breed,&rsquo; is really a
magnificent animal, with his long pendant ears, his open chest, and
broad-backed body. Hounds of the La Vendée and Poitou breeds are
also used at boar-hunts. Dogs, though they may be of excellent race,
require, however, skilful training before they will hunt the boar. It
is necessary they should see several boars killed ere they will venture
to tackle this formidable enemy, of which the dog is instinctively
afraid. House-dogs, curs, and terriers will at times pursue the boar
admirably, and prolong his standing for hours without approaching within
range of the beast&rsquo;s tusks, whilst animals of a higher spirit will allow
themselves to be ripped up alive, or, if they escape, will not dare to
again approach their foe after a first repulse.</p>

<p>Since boars became so numerous in the Champagne they have done
considerable damage to the crops, a corn or potato field being soon
devastated by them. At harvest-time a watch has often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
to be set for
them by night. A few years ago, at the moment of the vintage, people
were even compelled to light large fires near the vineyards to scare
away these dangerous neighbours.</p>

<p>The shooting season in the Champagne extends from the commencement of
September till the end of February; but boar-hunting is often prolonged
until the first of May, and occasionally <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">battues</i> are organised during
the summer.</p>

<p>Other four-footed game tenanting the forests of the Champagne are
the roe-deer, in tolerable quantity; a few fallow-deer and stags and
wolves, which latter are still numerous, spite of the warfare carried on
against them. The roe-deer is hunted, like the boar, with hounds; but
this easy sport, which does not possess the attraction of danger, is
quite neglected when boars are numerous. The forests also give shelter
to hares in abundance, martins, wild-cats, and foxes, the latter being
rigorously destroyed on account of their depredations. They are stifled
by smoke in their holes, or else poisoned or taken in traps.</p>

<p>Sportsmen are so numerous in every little village of the Marne, the
shooting license only costing five-and-twenty francs, that feathered
game has become very rare. The most remarkable specimen is the
caimpetière, or small bustard, which exists only in the Champagne and
Algeria, and the flesh of which is highly esteemed.</p>

<p>Partridges and hares would have entirely disappeared from the plains
were it not for the shelter which the vineyards afford them, for woe
to him who ventures to shoot among the vines! The vine is as sacred to
the Champenois as the mistletoe was to their Gallic forefathers. Great
severity is shown in respect to trespassers at the epoch when the vines
are sprouting, for each broken bud represents a bunch of grapes, which
its owner hoped might realise its weight in gold.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">A<span class="smaller">FTER</span> the Champagne, Anjou is the French province which ranks next in
importance for its production of sparkling wines. Vintaged on the banks
of the Loire, these are largely consigned to the English and other
markets, labelled Crême de Bouzy, Sillery and Ay Mousseux, Cartes Noires
and Blanches, and the like; while their corks are branded with the names
of phantom firms, supposed to be located at Reims and Epernay. As a
rule, these wines come from around Saumur; but they are not necessarily
the worse on that account, for the district produces capital sparkling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
wines, the finer qualities of which improve greatly by being kept for a
few years. One curious thing shown to us at Saumur was the album of a
manufacturer of sparkling wines containing examples of the many hundred
labels ticketed with which his produce had for years past been sold.
Not one of these labels assigned to the wines the name of their real
maker or their true birthplace, but introduced them under the auspices
of mythical dukes and counts, as being manufactured at châteaux which
are so many &lsquo;castles in Spain,&rsquo; and as coming from Ay, Bouzy, Châlons,
Epernay, Reims, and Verzenay, but never by any chance from Saumur.</p>

<p>Being produced from robuster growths than the sparkling wines of
the Department of the Marne, sparkling Saumur will always lack that
excessive lightness which is the crowning grace of fine Champagne;
still, it has only to be kept for a few years, instead of being drunk
shortly after its arrival from the wine-merchant, for its quality to
become greatly improved and its intrinsic value to be considerably
enhanced. We have drunk sparkling Saumur that had been in bottle for
nearly twenty years, and found the wine not only remarkably delicate,
but, singular to say, with plenty of effervescence.</p>

AT FONTEVRAULT.</p>
</div>

<p>To an Englishman Anjou is one of the most interesting of the ancient
provinces of France. It was the cradle of the Plantagenet kings, and
only ten miles from Saumur still repose the bones of Henry, the first
Plantagenet, and Richard of the Lion Heart, beneath their elaborate
coloured and gilt effigies, in the so-called Cimetière des Rois of the
historic Abbey of Fontevrault. The famous vineyards of the Coteau de
Saumur, eastward of the town and bordering the Loire, extend as far as
here, and include the communes of Dampierre, Souzay, Varrains, Chacé,
Parnay, Turquant, and Montsoreau, the last-named within three miles of
Fontevrault, and chiefly remarkable through its seigneur of ill-fame,
Jean de Chambes, who instigated his wife to lure Bussy d&rsquo;Amboise to an
assignation in order that he might the more surely poignard him. Saumur
is picturesquely placed at the foot of this bold range of heights, near
where the little river Thouet runs into the broad and rapid Loire.
A massive-looking old château, perched on the summit of an isolated
crag, stands out grandly against the clear sky and dominates the town,
the older houses of which crouch at the foot of the lofty hill and
climb its steepest sides. The restored antique Hôtel de Ville, in the
Pointed style, with its elegant windows, graceful belfry, and florid
wrought-iron balconies, stands back from the quay bordering the Loire.
In the rear is the Rue des Payens, whither the last of the Huguenots of
this &lsquo;metropolis of Protestantism,&rsquo; as it was formerly styled, retired,
converting their houses into so many fortresses to guard against being
surprised by their Catholic adversaries. Adjacent is the steep tortuous
Grande Rue, of which Balzac&mdash;himself a Tourangeau&mdash;has given such a
graphic picture in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Grandet</cite>, the scene of which is laid at
Saumur. To-day, however, only a few of its ancient carved-timber houses,
quaint overhanging corner turrets, and fantastically studded massive oak
doors, have escaped demolition.</p>

<p>The vineyards of the Coteau de Saumur, yielding the finest wines, are
reached by the road skirting the river, the opposite low banks of which
are fringed with willows and endless rows of poplars, which at the
time of our visit were already golden with the fading tints of autumn.
Numerous fantastic windmills crown the heights, the summit of which
is covered with vines, varied by dense patches of woodland. Here, as
elsewhere along the banks of the Loire, the many abandoned quarries
along the face of the hill have been turned by the peasants into cosy
dwellings by simply walling-up the entrances, while leaving, of course,
the necessary apertures for doors and windows. Dampierre, the first
village reached, has many of these cave-dwellings, and numbers of its
houses are picturesquely perched up the sides of the slope. The holiday
costumes of the peasant women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
encountered in the neighbourhood of
Saumur are exceedingly quaint, their elaborate and varied headdresses
being counterparts of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffures</i> in vogue so far back as three and four
centuries ago.</p>

<p class="caption">PEASANT WOMEN OF THE ENVIRONS OF SAUMUR.</p>
</div>

<p>Quitting the banks of the river, we ascend a steep tortuous road, shut
in on either side by high stone walls&mdash;for hereabouts all the best
vineyards are scrupulously enclosed&mdash;and finally reach the summit of
the heights, whence a view is gained over what the Saumurois proudly
style the grand valley of the Loire. Everywhere around the vintage is
going on. The vines are planted rather more than a yard apart, and those
yielding black grapes are trained, as a rule, up tall stakes, although
some few are trained espalier fashion. Women dexterously detach the
bunches with pruning-knives and throw them into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">seilles</i>&mdash;small
squat buckets with wooden handles&mdash;the contents of which are emptied
from time to time into baskets&mdash;the counterpart of the chiffonnier&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hotte</i>, and coated with pitch inside so as to close all the crevices of
the wickerwork&mdash;which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portes-bastes</i> carry slung to their backs.
When white wine is being made from black grapes for sparkling Saumur,
the grapes are conveyed in these baskets to the underground pressoirs in
the neighbouring villages before their skins get at all broken, in order
that the wine may be as pale as possible in colour.</p>

<p>The black grape yielding the best wine in the Saumur district is the
breton, said to be the same as the carbinet-sauvignon, the leading
variety in the grand vineyards of the Médoc. Other species of black
grapes cultivated around Saumur are the varennes, yielding a soft and
insipid wine of no kind of value, and the liverdun, or large gamay,
the prevalent grape in the Mâconnais, and the same which in the days
of Philippe-le-Hardi the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parlements</i> of Metz and Dijon interdicted
the planting and cultivation of. The prevalent white grapes are the
large and small pineau blanc, the bunches of the former being of an
intermediate size, broad and pyramidal in shape, and with the berries
close together. These have fine skins, are oblong in shape, and of a
transparent yellowish-green hue tinged with red, are very sweet and
juicy, and as a rule ripen late. As for the small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
pineau, the bunches
are less compact, the berries are round and of a golden tint, are finer
as well as sweeter in flavour, and ripen somewhat earlier than the fruit
of the larger variety.</p>

<p>We noticed as we drove through the villages of Champigny and
Varrains&mdash;the former celebrated for its fine red wines, and more
especially its cru of the Clos des Cordeliers&mdash;that hardly any of the
houses had windows looking on to the narrow street, but that all were
provided with low openings for shooting the grapes into the cellar,
where, when making red wine, they are trodden, but when making white
wine, whether from black or white grapes, they are invariably pressed.
Each of the houses had its ponderous porte-cochère and low narrow portal
leading into the large enclosed yard at its side, and over the high
blank walls vines were frequently trained, pleasantly varying their dull
gray monotony.</p>

<p>The grapes on being shot into the openings just mentioned fall through
a kind of tunnel into a reservoir adjacent to the heavy press, which
is invariably of wood and of the old-fashioned cumbersome type. They
are forthwith placed beneath the press and usually subjected to five
separate squeezes, the must from the first three being reserved for
sparkling wine, while that from the two latter, owing to its being more
or less deeply tinted, only serves for table-wine. The must is at once
run off into casks, in order that it may not ferment on the grape-skins
and imbibe any portion of their colouring matter. Active fermentation
speedily sets in, and lasts for a fortnight or three weeks, according to
whether the temperature chances to be high or low.</p>

<p>The vintaging of the white grapes takes place about a fortnight later
than the black grapes, and is commonly a compound operation, the best
and ripest bunches being first of all gathered just as the berries
begin to get shrivelled and show symptoms of approaching rottenness.
It is these selected grapes that yield the best wine. The second
gathering, which follows shortly after the first, includes all the
grapes remaining on the vines, and yields a wine perceptibly inferior in
quality. The grapes on their arrival at the press-house are generally
pressed immediately, and the must is run off into tuns to ferment. At
the commencement these tuns are filled up every three or four days to
replace the fermenting must which has flowed over; afterwards any waste
is made good at the interval of a week, and then once a fortnight, the
bungholes of the casks being securely closed towards the end of the
year, by which time the first fermentation is over.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the Saumur sparkling wine manufacturers draw
considerable supplies of the white wine, required to impart lightness
and effervescence to their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin préparé</i>, from the Vouvray vineyards.
Vouvray borders the Loire a few miles from the pleasant city of Tours,
which awakens sinister recollections of truculent Louis XI., shut up in
his fortified castle of Plessis-lez-Tours, around which Scott has thrown
the halo of his genius in his novel of <cite>Quentin Durward</cite>. A succession
of vineyard slopes stretch from one to another of the many historic
châteaux along this portion of the Loire, the romantic associations
of which render the Touraine one of the most interesting provinces of
France. Near Tours, besides the vineyards of Saint-Cyr are those of
Joué and Saint-Avertin; the two last situate on the opposite bank of
the Cher, where the little town of Joué, perched on the summit of a
hill in the midst of vineyards, looks over a vast plain known by the
country-people as the Landes de Charlemagne, the scene, according to
local tradition, of Charles Martel&rsquo;s great victory over the Saracens.
The Saint-Avertin vineyards extend towards the east, stretching almost
to the forest of Larçay, on the borders of the Cher, where Paul Louis
Courier, the famous vigneron pamphleteer of the Restoration, noted
alike for his raillery, wit, and satire, fell beneath the balls of an
assassin. A noticeable cru in the neighbourhood of Tours is that of
Cinq Mars, the ruined château of which survives as a memorial of the
vengeance of Cardinal Richelieu, who, after having sent its owner to the
scaffold, commanded its massive walls and towers to be razed &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à hauteur
d&rsquo;infamie</i>,&rsquo; as we see them now.</p>

<p>Touraine, from its central position, its pleasant air, and its fertile
soil, was ever a favourite residence of the earlier French monarchs,
and down to the days of the Bourbons the seat of government continually
vacillated between the banks of the Seine and those of the Loire. The
vintages that ripen along the river have had their day of court favour
too; for if Henri of Andelys sneeringly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
describes the wine of Tours
as turning sour, in his famous poem of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bataille des Vins</cite>, the
sweet white wines of Anjou were greatly esteemed throughout the Middle
Ages, and, with those of Orleans, were highly appreciated in Paris down
to the seventeenth century. The cult of the &lsquo;dive Bouteille&rsquo; and the
fashion of Pantagruelic repasts have always found favour in the fat and
fertile &lsquo;garden of France;&rsquo; and the spectacle of citizens, courtiers,
and monks staggering fraternally along, &lsquo;waggling their heads,&rsquo; as
Rabelais describes them, after a night of it at the tavern, was no
uncommon one in the streets of its old historic towns during the period
of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>On proceeding to Vouvray from Tours, we skirt a succession of
poplar-fringed meadows, stretching eastward in the direction of Amboise
along the right bank of the Loire; and after a time a curve in the river
discloses to view a range of vine-clad heights, extending some distance
beyond the village of Vouvray. Our route lies past the picturesque
ruins of the abbey of Marmoûtier, immortalised in the piquant pages of
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contes Drôlatiques</cite>, and the Château des Roches&mdash;one of the most
celebrated castles of the Loire&mdash;the numerous excavations in the soft
limestone ridge on which they are perched being converted as usual into
houses, magazines, and wine-cellars. We proceed through the village of
Rochecorbon, and along a road winding among the spurs of the Vouvray
range, past hamlets, half of whose inhabitants live in these primitive
dwellings hollowed out of the cliff, and finally enter the charming
Vallé Coquette, hemmed in on all sides with vine-clad slopes. Here
a picturesque old house, half château, half homestead, was pointed
out to us as a favourite place of sojourn of Balzac, who held the
wine of Vouvray in high esteem, and who speaks of this rocky ridge as
&lsquo;inhabited by a population of vine-dressers, their houses of several
stories being hollowed out in the face of the cliff, and connected by
dangerous staircases hewn in the soft stone. Smoke curls from most of
the chimneys which peep above the green crest of vines, while the blows
of the cooper&rsquo;s hammer resound in several of the cellars. A young girl
trips to her garden over the roofs of these primitive dwellings, and an
old woman, tranquilly seated on a ledge of projecting rock, supported
solely by straggling roots of ivy spreading itself over the disjointed
stones, leisurely turns her spinning-wheel, regardless of her dangerous
position.&rsquo; The foregoing picture, sketched by the author of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Comédie
Humaine</cite> forty years ago, has scarcely changed at the present day.</p>

<p>At the point where the village of Vouvray climbs half-way up the
vine-crested ridge the rapid-winding Cise throws itself into the Loire,
and on crossing the bridge that spans the tributary stream we discern on
the western horizon, far beyond the verdant islets studding the swollen
Loire, the tall campaniles of Tours Cathedral, which seem to rise out
of the water like a couple of Venetian towers. Vouvray is a trim little
place, clustered round about with numerous pleasant villas in the midst
of charming gardens. The modern château of Moncontour here dominates
the slope, and its terraced gardens, with their fantastically-clipped
trees and geometric parterres, rise tier above tier up the face of the
picturesque height that overlooks the broad fertile valley, with its
gardens, cultivated fields, patches of woodland, and wide stretches
of green pasture which, fringed with willows and poplars, border the
swollen waters of the Loire. Where the river Brenne empties itself
into the Cise the Coteau de Vouvray slopes off towards the north, and
there rise up the vine-clad heights of Vernou, yielding a similar but
inferior wine to that of Vouvray. The village of Vernou is nestled under
the hill, and near the porch of its quaint little church a venerable
elm-tree is pointed out as having been planted by Sully, Henry IV.&rsquo;s
able Minister. Here, too, an ancient wall, pierced with curious arched
windows, and forming part of a modern building, is regarded by popular
tradition as belonging to the palace in which Pépin-le-Bref, father of
Charlemagne, lived at Vernou.</p>

<p>The communes of Dampierre, Souzay, and Parnay, in the neighbourhood
of Saumur, produce still red wines rivalling those of Champigny,
besides which all the finest white wines are vintaged hereabouts&mdash;in
the Perrière, the Poilleux, and the Clos Morain vineyards, and in the
Rotissans vineyard at Turquant. Wines of very fair quality are also
grown on the more favourable slopes extending southwards along the
valley of the Thouet, and comprised in the communes of Varrains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Chacé, St. Cyr-en-Bourg, and Brézé. The whole of this district,
by the way, abounds with interesting archæological remains. While
visiting the vineyards of Varrains and Chacé we came upon a couple of
dolmens&mdash;vestiges of the ancient Celtic population of the valley of
the Loire singularly abundant hereabouts. Brézé, the marquisate of
which formerly belonged to Louis XVI.&rsquo;s famous grand master of the
ceremonies&mdash;immortalised by the rebuff he received from Mirabeau&mdash;boasts
a noble château on the site of an ancient fortress, in connection with
which there are contemporary excavations in the neighbouring limestone,
designed for a garrison of 500 or 600 men. Beyond the vineyards of
Saint-Florent, westward of Saumur and on the banks of the Thouet, is an
extensive plateau, partially overgrown with vines, where may be traced
the remains of a Roman camp. Moreover, in the southern environs of
Saumur, in the midst of vineyards producing exclusively white wines,
is one of the most remarkable dolmens known. This imposing structure,
perfect in all respects save that one of the four enormous stones which
roof it in has been split in two, and requires to be supported, is no
less than 65 feet in length, 23 feet in width, and 10 feet high.</p>

<p>At Saint-Florent, the pleasant little suburb of Saumur, skirting the
river Thouet, and sheltered by steep hills formed of soft limestone,
which offers great facilities for the excavation of extensive
cellars, the largest manufacturer of Saumur sparkling wines has his
establishment. Externally this offers but little to strike the eye. A
couple of pleasant country houses, half hidden by spreading foliage,
stand at the two extremities of a spacious and well-kept garden, beyond
which one catches a glimpse of some outbuildings sheltered by the
vine-crowned cliff, in which a labyrinth of gloomy galleries has been
hollowed out. Here M. Ackerman-Laurance, the extent of whose business
ranks him as second among the sparkling wine manufacturers of the world,
stores something like 10,000 casks and several million bottles of wine.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the present century, in the days when, as Balzac
relates in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Grandet</cite>, the Belgians bought up entire vintages
of Saumur wine, then largely in demand with them for sacramental
purposes, the founder of the Saint-Florent house commenced to deal
in the ordinary still wines of the district. Nearly half a century
ago he was led to attempt the manufacture of sparkling wines, but his
efforts to bring them into notice failed; and he was on the point of
abandoning his enterprise, when an order for one hundred cases revived
his hopes, and led to the foundation of the present vast establishment.
As already mentioned, for many miles all the heights along the Loire
have been more or less excavated for stone for building purposes, so
that every one hereabouts who grows wine or deals in it has any amount
of cellar accommodation ready to hand. It was the vast extent of the
galleries which M. Ackerman <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">père</i> discovered already excavated at
Saint-Florent that induced him to settle there in preference to Saumur.
Extensive, however, as the original vaults were, considerable additional
excavations have from time to time been found necessary; and to-day the
firm is still further increasing the area of its cellars, which already
comprise three principal avenues, each the third of a mile long, and
no fewer than sixty transverse galleries, the total length of which is
several miles. One great advantage is that the whole are on the ordinary
level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Ranged against the black uneven walls of the more tortuous ancient
vaults which give access to these labyrinthine corridors are thousands
of casks of wine&mdash;some in single rows, others in triple tiers&mdash;forming
the reserve stock of the establishment. As may be supposed, a powerful
vinous odour permeates these vaults, in which the fumes of wine have
been accumulating for the best part of a century. After passing beneath
a massive stone arch which separates the old cellars from the new, a
series of broad and regularly proportioned galleries are reached, having
bottles stacked in their tens of thousands on either side. Overhead the
roof is perforated at regular intervals with circular shafts, affording
both light and ventilation, and enabling the temperature to be regulated
to a nicety. In these lateral and transverse galleries millions of
bottles of wine in various stages of preparation are stacked.</p>

LABELLING AND PACKING SPARKLING SAUMUR.</p>
</div>

<p>We have explained that in the Champagne it is the custom for the
manufacturers of sparkling wine to purchase considerable quantities of
grapes from the surrounding growers, and to press these themselves,
or have them pressed under their own superintendence. At Saumur only
those firms possessing vineyards make their own <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i>, the bulk
of the wine used for conversion into sparkling wine being purchased
from the neighbouring growers. On the newly-expressed must arriving
at M. Ackerman-Laurance&rsquo;s cellars it is allowed to rest until the
commencement of the ensuing year, when half of it is mixed with wine
in stock belonging to last year&rsquo;s vintage, and the remaining half is
reserved for mingling with the must of the ensuing vintage. The blending
is accomplished in a couple of colossal vats hewn out of the rock, and
coated on the inside with cement. Each of these vats is provided with
200 paddles for thoroughly mixing the wine, and with five pipes for
drawing it off when the amalgamation is complete. Usually the cuvée will
embrace 1600 hogsheads, or 80,000 gallons of wine, almost sufficient
for half a million bottles. A fourth of this quantity can be mixed in
each vat at a single operation, and this mixing is repeated again and
again until the last gallon run off is of precisely the same type as the
first. For the finer qualities of sparkling Saumur the proportion of
wine from the black grapes to that from white is generally at the rate
of three or four to one. For the inferior qualities more wine from white
than from black grapes is invariably used. Only in the wine from white
grapes is the effervescent principle retained to any particular extent;
but, on the other hand, the wine from black grapes imparts both quality
and vinous character to the blend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>The blending having been satisfactorily accomplished, the wine is
stored in casks, never perfectly filled, yet with their bungholes
tightly closed, and slowly continues its fermentation, eating up its
sugar, purging itself, and letting fall its lees. Three months later it
is fined. It is rarely kept in the wood for more than a year, though
sometimes the superior qualities remain for a couple of years in cask.
Occasionally it is even bottled in the spring following the vintage;
still, as a rule, the bottling of sparkling Saumur takes place during
the ensuing summer months, when the temperature is at the highest,
as this insures to it a greater degree of effervescence. At the time
of bottling its saccharine strength is raised to a given degree by
the addition of the finest sugar-candy, and henceforward the wine is
subjected to precisely the same treatment as is pursued with regard to
Champagne.</p>

<p>It is in a broad but sombre gallery of the more ancient vaults&mdash;the
roughly-hewn walls of which are black from the combined action of
alcohol and carbonic acid gas&mdash;that the processes of disgorging the
wine of its sediment, adding the syrup, filling up the bottles with
wine to replace that which gushes out when the disgorging operation is
performed, together with the re-corking, stringing, and wiring of the
bottles, are carried on. The one or two adjacent shafts impart very
little light, but a couple of resplendent metal reflectors, which at a
distance one might fancy to be some dragon&rsquo;s flaming eyes, combined with
the lamps placed near the people at work, effectually illuminate the
spot.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CELLARS OF M. LOUIS DUVAU AÎNÉ AT THE CHÂTEAU OF
VARRAINS.</p>
</div>

<p>Another considerable manufacturer of sparkling Saumur is M. Louis
Duvau aîné, owner of the château of Varrains, in the village of the
same name, at no great distance from the Coteau de Saumur. His cellars
adjoin the château, a picturesque but somewhat neglected structure
of the last century, with sculptured medallions in high relief above
the lower windows, and florid vases surmounting the mansards in the
roof. In front is a large rambling court shaded with acacia and lime
trees, and surrounded by outbuildings, prominent among which is a
picturesque dovecot, massive at the base as a martello tower, and
having an elegant open stone lantern springing from its bell-shaped
roof. The cellars are entered down a steep incline under a low stone
arch, the masonry above which is overgrown with ivy in large clusters
and straggling creeping plants. We soon come upon a deep recess to the
right, wherein stands a unique cumbersome screw-press, needing ten or
a dozen men to work the unwieldy capstan which sets the juice flowing
from the crushed grapes into the adjacent shallow trough. On our left
hand are a couple of ancient reservoirs, formed out of huge blocks of
stone, with the entrance to a long vaulted cellar filled with wine in
cask. We advance slowly in the uncertain light along a succession of
gloomy galleries, with moisture oozing from their blackened walls and
roofs, picking our way between bottles of wine stacked in huge square
piles and rows of casks raised in tiers. Suddenly a broad flood of
light shooting down a lofty shaft throws a Rembrandtish effect across
a spacious and most melodramatic-looking cave, roughly hewn out of the
rock, and towards which seven dimly-lighted galleries converge. On all
sides a scene of bustling animation presents itself. From one gallery
men keep arriving with baskets of wine ready for the disgorger; while
along another bottles of wine duly dosed with syrup are being borne off to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
decorated with metal foil and their distinctive labels. Groups
of workmen are busily engaged disgorging, dosing, and re-corking the
newly-arrived bottles of wine; corks fly out with a succession of loud
reports, suggestive of the irregular fire of a party of skirmishers;
a fizzing, spurting, and spluttering of the wine next ensues, and is
followed by the incessant clicking of the various apparatus employed in
the corking and wiring of the bottles.</p>

<div class="figleft">
   <a id="fig325" name="fig325"></a>
   <img class="top1 bottom1" src="images/fig325.png"
      alt="Vintager and Her Grapes" />
</div>

<p>Gradual inclines conduct to the two lower tiers of galleries, for the
cellars of M. Duvau consist of as many as three stories. Down below
there is naturally less light, and the temperature, too, is sensibly
colder. Advantage is taken of this latter circumstance to remove
the newly-bottled wine to these lower vaults whenever an excessive
development of carbonic acid threatens the bursting of an undue
proportion of bottles, a casualty which among the Saumur sparkling
wine manufacturers ranges far higher than with the manufacturers of
Champagne. For the economy of time and labour, a lift, raised and
lowered by means of a capstan worked by horses, is employed to transfer
the bottles of wine from one tier of cellars to another.</p>

<p>The demand for sparkling Saumur is evidently on the increase, for M.
Duvau, at the time of our visit, was excavating extensive additional
cellarage. The subsoil at Varrains being largely composed of marl, which
is much softer than the tufa of the Saint-Florent coteau, necessitated
the roofs of the new galleries being worked in a particular form in
order to avoid having recourse to either brickwork or masonry. Tons
of this excavated marl were being spread over the soil of M. Duvau&rsquo;s
vineyard in the rear of the château, greatly, it was said, to the
benefit of the vines, whose grapes were all of the black variety;
indeed, scarcely any wine is vintaged from white grapes in the commune
of Varrains.</p>

<p>At M. Duvau&rsquo;s we went through a complete scale of sparkling Saumurs,
commencing with the younger and less matured samples, and ascending
step by step to wines a dozen and more years old. Every year seemed to
produce an improvement in the wine, the older varieties gaining greatly
in delicacy and softening very perceptibly in flavour.</p>

<div class="figright">

      alt="Vintager with a Basket Full of Grapes" />
</div>

<p>Finding that sparkling wines were being made in most of the
wine-producing districts of France, where the growths were sufficiently
light and of the requisite quality, Messrs. E. Normandin &amp; Co. conceived
the idea of laying the famous Bordeaux district under contribution
for a similar purpose, and, aided by a staff of experienced workmen
from Epernay, they have succeeded in producing a sparkling Sauternes.
Sauternes, as is well known, is one of the finest of white wines,
soft, delicate, and of beautiful flavour, and its transformation
into a sparkling wine has been very successfully accomplished.
Messrs. Normandin&rsquo;s head-quarters are in the thriving little town
of Châteauneuf, in the pleasant valley of the Charente, and within
fifteen miles of Angoulême, a famous old French town, encompassed by
ancient ramparts and crumbling corner-towers; and which, dominated by
the lofty belfry of its restored semi-Byzantine cathedral, rising in
a series of open arcades, spreads itself picturesquely out along a
precipitous height, watered at its base by the rivers Anguienne and
Charente. Between Angoulême and Châteauneuf vineyard plots dotted
over with walnut-trees, or simple rows of vines divided by strips of
ripening maize, and broken up at intervals by bright green pastures,
line both banks of the river Charente. The surrounding country is
undulating and picturesque. Poplars and elms fringe the roadsides,
divide the larger fields and vineyards, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
screen the cosy-looking
red-roofed farmhouses, which present to the eyes of the passing tourist
a succession of pictures of quiet rural prosperity.</p>

<p>Châteauneuf communicates with the Sauternes district by rail, so
that supplies of wine from there are readily obtainable. Vin de
Colombar&mdash;a famous white growth which English and Dutch cruisers used
to ascend the Charente to obtain cargoes of when the Jerez wines were
shut out from England by the Spanish War of Succession&mdash;vintaged
principally at Montignac-le-Coq, also enters largely into Messrs.
Normandin &amp; Co.&rsquo;s sparkling Sauternes cuvée. This colombar grape is
simply the semillon&mdash;one of the leading varieties of the Sauternes
district&mdash;transported to the Charente. The remarkably cool cellars where
the firm store their wine, whether in wood or bottle, have been formed
from some vast subterranean galleries whence centuries ago stone was
quarried, and which are situated about a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s drive
from Châteauneuf, in the midst of vineyards and cornfields. The wine is
invariably bottled in a cellier at the head establishment, but it is
in these cellars where it goes through the course of careful treatment
similar to that pursued with regard to Champagne.</p>

<p>In order that the delicate flavour of the wine may be preserved, the
liqueur is prepared with the finest old Sauternes, without any addition
of spirit, and the dose is administered with the most improved modern
appliance, constructed of silver, and provided with crystal taps. At the
Concours Régional d&rsquo;Angoulême of 1877, the jury, after recording that
they had satisfied themselves by the aid of a chemical analysis that the
samples of sparkling Sauternes submitted to their judgment were free
from any foreign ingredient, awarded to Messrs. Normandin &amp; Co. the only
gold medal given in the Group of Alimentary Products.</p>

<p>Encouraged, no doubt, by the success obtained by Messrs. Normandin &amp;
Co. with their sparkling Sauternes, the house of Lermat-Robert &amp; Co.,
of Bordeaux, introduced a few years ago a sparkling Barsac, samples of
which were submitted to the jury at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap p2">S<span class="smaller">PARKLING</span> wines are made to a considerable extent in Burgundy, notably
at Beaune, Nuits, and Dijon; and though as a rule heavier and more
potent than the subtile and delicate-flavoured wines of the Marne, still
some of the higher qualities, both of the red and white varieties,
exhibit a degree of refinement which those familiar only with the
commoner kinds can scarcely form an idea of. At the Paris Exhibition of
1878 we tasted, among a large collection of the sparkling wines of the
Côte d&rsquo;Or, samples of Chambertin, Romanée, and Vougeot, of the highest
order. Although red wines, they had the merit of being deficient in
that body which forms such an objectionable feature in sparkling wines
of a deep shade of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
colour. M. Regnier, the exhibitor of sparkling red
Vougeot, sent, moreover, a white sparkling wine, from the species of
grape known locally as the clos blanc de Vougeot. These wines, as well
as the Chambertin, came from the Côte de Nuits, the growths of which are
generally considered of too vigorous a type for successful conversion
into sparkling wine, preference being usually given to the produce of
the Côte de Beaune. Among the sparkling Burgundies from the last-named
district were samples from Savigny, Chassagne, and Meursault, all famous
for their fine white wines.</p>

<p>Burgundy ranks as one of the oldest viticultural regions of Central
Europe, and for centuries its wines have been held in the highest
renown. In the Middle Ages both the wines and vines of this favoured
province passed as presents from one royal personage to another, just as
grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordons</i> are exchanged between them nowadays. The fabrication of
sparkling wine, however, dates no further back than some sixty years or
so. The system of procedure is much the same as in the Champagne, and,
as there, the wine is mainly the produce of the pineau noir and pineau
blanc varieties of grape. At the vintage, in order to avoid bruising the
ripened fruit and to guard against premature fermentation, the grapes
are conveyed to the pressoirs in baskets, instead of the large oval vats
termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balonges</i>, common to the district. They are placed beneath the
press as soon as possible, and for superior sparkling wines only the
juice resulting from the first pressure, and known as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mère goutte</i>,
or mother drop, is employed. For the ordinary wines, that expressed at
the second squeezing of the fruit is mingled with the other. The must
is at once run off into casks, which have been previously sulphured, to
check, in a measure, the ardour of the first fermentation, and lighten
the colour of the newly-made wine. Towards the end of October, when this
first fermentation is over, the wine is removed to the cellars, or to
some other cool place, and in December it is racked into other casks. In
the April following it is again racked, to insure its being perfectly
clear at the epoch of bottling in the month of May. The sulphuring
of the original casks having had the effect of slightly checking the
fermentation and retaining a certain amount of saccharine in the wine,
it is only on exceptional occasions that the latter is artificially
sweetened previous to being bottled.</p>

<p>A fortnight after the tirage the wine commonly attains the stage known
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand mousseux</i>, and by the end of September the breakage will have
amounted to between 5 and 8 per cent, which necessitates the taking
down the stacks of bottles and piling them up anew. The wine as a rule
remains in the cellars for fully a couple of years from the time of
bottling until it is shipped. Posing the bottles <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur pointe</i>, agitating
them daily, together with the disgorging and liqueuring of the wine, are
accomplished precisely as in the Champagne.</p>

<p>Among the principal manufacturers of sparkling Burgundies are Messrs.
André &amp; Voillot, of Beaune, whose sparkling white Romanée, Nuits, and
Volnay are well and favourably known in England; M. Louis Latour, also
of Beaune, and equally noted for his sparkling red Volnay, Nuits, and
Chambertin, as for his sparkling white varieties; Messrs. Maire et Fils,
likewise of Beaune; M. Labouré-Goutard and Messrs. Geisweiller et Fils,
of Nuits; Messrs. Marey &amp; Liger-Belair, of Nuits and Vosne; and M.
Regnier, of Dijon.</p>

<p>In the department of the Yonne&mdash;that is, in Lower Burgundy&mdash;sparkling
wines somewhat alcoholic in character have been made for the last half
century at Tonnerre, where the Chevalier d&rsquo;Eon, that enigma of his
epoch, was born. The Tonnerre vineyards are of high antiquity, and
for sparkling wines the produce of the black and white pineau and the
white morillon varieties of grape is had recourse to. The vintaging is
accomplished with great care, and only the juice which flows from the
first pressure is employed. This is run off immediately into casks,
which are hermetically closed when the fermentation has subsided. The
after-treatment of the wine is the same as in the Champagne. Sparkling
wines are likewise made at Epineuil, a village in the neighbourhood of
Tonnerre, and at Chablis, so famous for its white wines, about ten miles
distant.</p>

<p>An effervescing wine known as the Vin d&rsquo;Arbanne is made at Bar-sur-Aube,
some fifty miles north-east of Tonnerre, on the borders of Burgundy,
but actually in the province of Champagne, although far beyond the
limits to which the famed viticultural district extends. It was at
Bar-sur-Aube where the Bastard de Bourbon, chief of the sanguinary
gang of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écorcheurs</i> (flayers), was sewn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
up in a sack and flung
over the parapet of the old stone bridge into the river beneath, by
order of Charles VII.; and here, too, Madame de la Motte, of Diamond
Necklace notoriety, was married, and in after years made a parade
of the ill-gotten wealth she had acquired by successfully fooling
that infatuated libertine the Cardinal Prince de Rohan, until her
ostentatious display was cut short by her arrest. This Vin d&rsquo;Arbanne
is produced from pineaux and white gamay grapes, which, after being
gathered with care at the moment the dew falls, are forthwith pressed.
The wine is left on its lees until the following February, when it is
racked and fined, the bottling taking place when the moon is at the full

<p>Red and white sparkling wines are made to a small extent at Saint-Lager,
in the Beaujolais, from wine vintaged in the Mont-Brouilly vineyards,
one of the best known of the Beaujolais crus. Mont-Brouilly is a lofty
hill near the village of Cercie, and is covered from base to summit on
all its sides with vines of the gamay species, rarely trained at all,
but left to trail along the ground at their own sweet will. At the
vintage, as we witnessed it, men and women&mdash;young, middle-aged, and
old&mdash;accompanied by troops of children, were roaming all over the slopes
dexterously nipping off the bunches of grapes with their thumb and
finger nails, and flinging them into the little wooden tubs with which
they were provided. The pressing of the grapes and the after-treatment
of the wine destined to become sparkling are the same in the Beaujolais
as in Upper and Lower Burgundy.</p>

<p>The red, straw, and yellow wines of the Jura have long had a high
reputation in the East of France, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vin Jaune</i> of Arbois, an
ancient fortified town on the banks of the Cuisance, besieged and sacked
in turn by Charles of Amboise, Henri IV., and Louis XIV., was one of the
favourite beverages of the tippling Béarnais who styled himself Seigneur
of Ay and Gonesse, and who acquired his liking for it while sojourning
during the siege of Arbois at the old Château des Arsures. In one of
Henri Quatre&rsquo;s letters to his minister Sully we find him observing, &lsquo;I
send you two bottles of Vin d&rsquo;Arbois, for I know you do not detest it.&rsquo;
A couple of other bottles of the same wine are said to have cemented the
king&rsquo;s reconciliation with Mayenne, the leader of the League; and the
lover of La Belle Gabrielle is moreover credited with having composed at
his mistress&rsquo;s table some doggrel rhymes in honour of the famous Jura
cru:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In more modern times the Jura, not content with the fame of the
historic yellow wines of Arbois and the deservedly-esteemed straw wines
of Château-Châlon, has produced large quantities of sparkling wine,
the original manufacture of which commenced as far back as a century
ago. To-day the principal seats of the manufacture are at Arbois and
Lons-le-Saulnier, the latter town the capital of the department, and one
of the most ancient towns of France. Originally founded by the Gauls
on the banks of the Vallière, in a little valley bordered by lofty
hills, which are to-day covered with vines, it was girded round with
fortifications by the Romans. Subsequently the Huns and the Vandals
pillaged it; then the French and the Burgundians repeatedly contested
its possession, and it was only definitively acquired by France during
the reign of Louis XIV. Rouget de l&rsquo;Isle, the famous author of the
&lsquo;Marseillaise,&rsquo; was born at Lons-le-Saulnier, and here also Marshal Ney
assembled and harangued his troops before marching to join Napoleon,
whom he had promised Louis XVIII. to bring back to Paris in an iron cage.</p>

<p>The vineyards whence the principal supplies for these sparkling wines
are derived are grouped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
at varying distances around Lons-le-Saulnier at
L&rsquo;Etoile, Quintigny, Salins, Arbois, St. Laurent-la-Roche, and Pupillin,
with the Jura chain of mountains rising up grandly on the east. The
best vineyards at L&rsquo;Etoile&mdash;which lies some couple of miles from
Lons-le-Saulnier, surrounded by hills, planted from base to summit with
vines&mdash;are La Vigne Blanche, Montmorin, and Montgenest. At Quintigny,
the wines of which are less potent than those of Arbois, and only retain
their effervescent properties for a couple of years, the Paridis,
Prémelan, and Montmorin vineyards are held in most repute, while at
Pupillin, where a soft agreeable wine is vintaged, the principal
vineyards are the Faille and the Clos. The vines cultivated for the
production of sparkling wines are chiefly the savagnin, or white pineau,
the melon of Poligny, and the poulsard, a black variety of grape held
locally in much esteem.</p>

<p>At the vintage, which commences towards the end of October and lasts
until the middle of the following month, all the rotten or unripe grapes
are carefully set aside, and the sound ones only submitted to the action
of a screw-press. After the must has flowed for about half an hour, the
grapes are newly collected under the press and the screw again applied.
The produce of this double operation is poured into a vat termed a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sapine</i>, where it remains until bubbles are seen escaping through the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau</i> that forms on the surface of the liquid. The must is then
drawn off&mdash;sometimes after being fined&mdash;into casks, which the majority
of wine-growers previously impregnate with the fumes of sulphur. When
in cask the wine is treated in one of two ways; either the casks are
kept constantly filled to the bunghole, causing the foam which rises to
the surface during the fermentation to flow over, and thereby leave the
wine comparatively clear, or else the casks are not completely filled,
in which case the wine requires to be racked several times before it
is in a condition for fining. This latter operation is effected about
the commencement of February, and a second fining follows if the first
one fails to render the wine perfectly clear. At the bottling, which
invariably takes place in April, the Jura wines rarely require any
addition of sugar to insure an ample effervescence. Subsequently they
are treated in exactly the same manner as the vintages of the Marne
are treated by the great Champagne manufacturers. In addition to white
sparkling wine, a pink variety, with natural effervescent properties, is
made by mixing with the savagnin and melon grapes a certain proportion
of the poulsard species, from which the best red wines of the Jura are
produced.</p>

<p>One of the principal sparkling wine establishments at Lons-le-Saulnier
is that of M. Auguste Devaux, founded in the year 1860. He manufactures
both sweet and dry wines, which are sold largely in France and elsewhere
on the Continent, and have lately been introduced into England. Their
alcoholic strength is equivalent to from 25° to 26° of proof spirit,
being largely above the dry sparkling wines of the Champagne, which the
Jura manufacturers regard as a positive advantage rather than a decided
drawback, which it most undoubtedly is.</p>

<p>Besides being too spirituous, the sparkling wines of the Jura are
deficient in refinement and delicacy. The commoner kinds, indeed,
frequently have a pronounced unpleasant flavour, due to the nature
of the soil, to careless vinification, or to the inferior quality of
liqueur with which the wines have been dosed. Out of some fifty samples
of all ages and varieties which in my capacity of juror I tasted at
the Paris Exhibition of 1878, I cannot call to mind one that a real
connoisseur of sparkling wines would care to admit to his table.</p>

<p>Sparkling wines are made after a fashion in several of the southern
provinces of France&mdash;in Auvergne, at Clermont-Ferrand, under the shadow
of the lofty Puy de Dôme; in Guienne, at Astaffort, the scene of a
bloody engagement during the Wars of Religion, in which the Protestant
army was cut to pieces when about to cross the Garonne; at Nérac, where
frail Marguerite de Valois kept her dissolute Court, and Catherine de
Médicis brought her flying squadron of fascinating maids-of-honour to
gain over the Huguenot leaders to the Catholic cause; and at Cahors, the
Divina, or divine fountain of the Celts, and the birthplace of Pope John
XXII., of Clement Marot, the early French poet, and of Léon Gambetta;
in Dauphiné, at Die, Saint-Chef, Saint-Péray, and Largentière&mdash;so named
after some abandoned silver mines&mdash;and where the vines are cultivated
against low walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
rising in a series of terraces from the base to the
summit of the lofty hills; and in Languedoc, at Brioude, where St.
Vincent, the patron saint of the vine-dressers, suffered martyrdom, and
where it is the practice to expose the must of the future sparkling wine
for several nights to the dew in order to rid it of its reddish colour;
also at Linardie, and, more southward still, at Limoux, whence comes the
well-known effervescing Blanquette.</p>

<p>Principal among the foregoing is the excellent wine of Saint-Péray,
commonly characterised as the Champagne of the South of France. The
Saint-Péray vineyards border the Rhone some ten miles below the
Hermitage coteau&mdash;the vines of which are to-day well-nigh destroyed by
the phylloxera&mdash;but are on the opposite bank of the river. Our visit to
Saint-Péray was made from Valence, in which dull southern city we had
loitered in order to glance at the vast Hôtel du Gouvernement&mdash;where
octogenarian Pius VI., after being spirited away a prisoner from Rome
and hurried over the Alps in a litter by order of the French Directory,
drew his last breath while silently gazing across the rushing river at
the view he so much admired&mdash;and to discover the house in the Grande
Rue, numbered 4, in an attic of which history records that Napoleon I.,
when a sub-lieutenant of artillery in garrison at Valence, resided, and
which he quitted owing three and a half francs to his pastrycook.</p>

<p>We crossed the Rhone over one of its hundred flimsy suspension-bridges,
on the majority of which a notice warns you neither to smoke nor run,
and were soon skirting the base of a lofty, bare, precipitous rock, with
the &lsquo;horns of Crussol,&rsquo; as the peasants term two tall pointed gables
of a ruined feudal château, perched at the dizzy edge, and having a
perpendicular fall of some five or six hundred feet below. The château,
which formerly belonged to the Dukes of Uzès, recognised by virtue of
the extent of their domains as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premiers pairs de France</i>, was not
originally erected in close proximity to any such formidable precipice.
The crag on which it stands had, it seems, been blasted from time to
time for the sake of the stone, until on one unlucky occasion, when too
heavy a charge of powder was employed, the entire side of the rock,
together with a considerable portion of the château itself, were sent
flying into the air. The authorities, professing to regard what remained
of the edifice as an historical monument of the Middle Ages, hereupon
stepped in and prohibited the quarry being worked for the future.</p>

</div>

<p>Passing beneath the cliff, one wound round to the left and dived into
a picturesque wooded dell at the entrance to a mountain pass, then
crossed the rocky bed of a dried-up stream, and drove along an avenue
of mulberry-trees, which in a few minutes conducted us to Saint-Péray,
where one found the vintage in full operation. Carts laden with tubs
filled with white and purple grapes, around which wasps without number
swarmed, were arriving from all points of the environs and crowding the
narrow streets. Any quantity of grapes were seemingly to be had for the
asking, for all the pretty girls in the place were gorging themselves
with the luscious-looking fruit. In the coopers&rsquo; yards brand-new casks
were ranged in rows in readiness for the newly-made wine, and through
open doorways, and in all manner of dim recesses, one caught sight of
sturdy men energetically trampling the gushing grapes under their bare
feet, and of huge creaking winepresses reeking with the purple juice.
It was chiefly common red wine, of an excellent flavour, however, that
was being made in these nooks and corners, the sparkling white wine
known as Saint-Péray being manufactured in larger establishments, and
on more scientific principles. It is from a white species of grape
known as the petite and grosse rousette&mdash;the same which yields the
white Hermitage&mdash;that the Champagne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of the south is produced; and the
vineyards where they are cultivated occupy all the more favourable
slopes immediately outside the village, the most noted being the
Coteau-Gaillard, Solignacs, Thioulet, and Hungary.</p>

<p>Although there is a close similarity between the manufacture of
Champagne and the effervescing wine of Saint-Péray, there are still one
or two noteworthy variations. For a wine to be sparkling it is requisite
that it should ferment in the bottle, a result obtained by bottling
it while it contains a certain undeveloped proportion of alcohol and
carbonic acid, represented by so much sugar, of which they are the
component parts. This ingredient has frequently to be added to the
Champagne wines to render them sparkling, but the wine of Saint-Péray
in its natural state contains so much sugar that any addition would
be deleterious. This excess of saccharine enables the manufacturer
to dispense with some of the operations necessary to the fabrication
of Champagne, which, after fermenting in the cask, requires a second
fermentation to be provoked in the bottle, whereas the Saint-Péray
wine ferments only once, being bottled immediately it comes from the
wine-press.</p>

<p>The deposit in the wine after being impelled towards the neck of the
bottle is got rid of by following the same system as is pursued in the
Champagne, but no liqueur whatever is subsequently added to the wine.
On the other hand, it is a common practice to reduce the over-sweetness
of sparkling Saint-Péray in years when the grapes are more than usually
ripe by mixing with it some old dry white wine.</p>

<p>At Saint-Péray we visited the cellars of M. de Saint-Prix, one of the
principal wine-growers of the district. The samples of effervescing wine
which he produced for us to taste were of a pale golden colour, of a
slightly nutty flavour, and with a decided suggestion of the spirituous
essence known to be concentrated in the wine, one glass of which will go
quite as far towards elevating a person as three glasses of Champagne.
Keeping the wine for a few years is said materially to improve its
quality, to the sacrifice, however, of its effervescing properties. M.
de Saint-Prix informed us that he manufactured every year a certain
quantity of sparkling Côte-Rotie, Château-Grillé, and Hermitage. The
principal markets for the Saint-Péray sparkling wines&mdash;the production
of which falls considerably short of a million bottles per annum&mdash;are
England, Germany, Russia, Holland, and Belgium.</p>

      alt="Collecting Grapes" />
</div>

<p>The other side of the Rhone is fruitful in minor sparkling wines, chief
among which is the so-called Clairette de Die, made at the town of
that name, a place of some splendour, as existing antiquities show, in
the days of the Roman dominion in Gaul. Later on, Die was the scene
of constant struggles for supremacy between its counts and bishops,
one of the latter being massacred by the populace in front of the
cathedral doorway&mdash;ever since known by the sinister appellation of the
Porte Rouge&mdash;and Catholics and Huguenots alike devastated the town in
the troublesome times of the Reformation. Clairette de Die is made
principally from the blanquette or malvoisie variety of grape, which,
after the stalks have been removed, is both trodden with the feet and
pressed. The must is run off immediately into casks, and four-and-twenty
hours later it is racked into other casks, a similar operation being
performed every two or three days for the period of a couple of months,
when, the fermentation having subsided, the wine is fined and usually
bottled in the following March. Newly-made Clairette de Die is a sweet
sparkling wine, but it loses its natural effervescence after a couple of
years, unless it has been treated in the same manner as Champagne, which
is rarely the case. The wine enjoys a reputation altogether beyond its
merits.</p>

<p>In addition to the well-known Clairette, some of the wine-growers
of Die make sparkling white and rose-coloured muscatels of superior
quality, which retain their effervescing properties for several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
years. A sparkling wine is also made some ten miles from Die, on the road
to Saillans, in a district bounded on the one side by the waters of
the Drôme, and on the other by strange mountains with helmet-shaped
crests. The centre of production is a locality called Vercheny, composed
of several hamlets, one of which, named Le Temple, was the original
home of the family of Barnave. The impressionable young deputy to the
National Assembly formed one of the trio sent to bring back the French
royal family from Varennes after their flight from Paris. It will be
remembered how, under the influence of Marie Antoinette and Madame
Elizabeth, Barnave became transformed during the journey into a faithful
partisan of their unhappy cause, and that he eventually paid the penalty
of his devotion with his life.</p>

<p>In the extreme south of France, and almost under the shadow of the
Pyrenees, a sparkling wine of some repute is made at a place called
Lagrasse, about five-and-twenty miles westward of Narbonne, the
once-famous Mediterranean city, the maritime rival of Marseilles, and
in its palmy days, prior to the Christian era, a miniature Rome, with
its capitol, its curia, its decemvirs, its consuls, its prætors, its
questors, its censors, and its ediles, and which boasted of being the
birthplace of three Roman Emperors. To-day Narbonne has to content
itself with the humble renown derived from its delicious honey and
its characterless full-bodied wines. Limoux, so celebrated for its
Blanquette, lies a long way farther to the west, behind the Corbières
range of mountains that join on to the Pyrenees, and the jagged peaks,
deep barren gorges, and scarred sides of which have been witness of many
a desperate struggle during the century and a half when they formed the
boundary between France and Spain.</p>

<p>We arrived at Limoux just too late for the famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> of the Black
Virgin, which lasts three weeks, and attracts crowds of southern
pilgrims to the chapel of Our Lady of Marseilles, perched on a little
hill some short distance from the town, with a fountain half-way up,
whose water issues drop by drop, and has the credit of possessing
unheard-of virtues. The majority of pilgrims, however, exhibit a decided
preference for the new-made wine over the miraculous water, and for
one-and-twenty days something like a carnival of inebriety prevails at
Limoux.</p>

<p>Blanquette de Limoux derives its name from the species of grape it is
produced from, and which we believe to be identical with the malvoisie,
or malmsey. Its long-shaped berries grow in huge bunches, and dry
readily on the stalks. The fruit is gathered as tenderly as possible,
care being taken that it shall not be in the slightest degree bruised,
and is then spread out upon a floor to admit of whatever sugar it
contains becoming perfect. The bad grapes having been carefully picked
out, and the seeds extracted from the remaining fruit, the latter is
now trodden, and the must, after being filtered through a strainer, is
placed in casks, where it remains fermenting for about a week, during
which time any overflow is daily replenished by other must reserved for
the purpose. The wine is again clarified, and placed in fresh casks with
the bungholes only lightly closed until all sensible fermentation has
ceased, when they are securely fastened up. The bottling takes place in
the month of March, and the wine is subsequently treated much after the
same fashion as sparkling Saint-Péray, excepting that it is generally
found necessary to repeat the operation of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégorgement</i> three, if not
as many as four, times.</p>

<p>Blanquette de Limoux is a pale white wine, the saccharine properties
of which have become completely transformed into carbonic acid gas
and alcohol. It is consequently both dry and spirituous, deficient in
delicacy, and altogether proves a great disappointment. At its best it
may, perhaps, rank with sparkling Saint-Péray, but unquestionably not
with an average Champagne.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap p2">I<span class="smaller">N</span> selecting a sparkling wine, one fact should be borne in mind&mdash;that
just as, according to Sam Weller, it is the seasoning which makes the
pie mutton, beef, or veal, so it is the liqueur which renders the
wine dry or sweet, light or strong. A really palatable dry Champagne,
emitting the fragrant bouquet which distinguishes all wines of fine
quality, free from added spirit, is obliged to be made of the very
best <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i>, to which necessarily an exceedingly small percentage
of liqueur will be added. On the other hand, a sweet Champagne can be
produced from the most ordinary raw wine&mdash;the Yankees even claim to
have evolved it from petroleum&mdash;as the amount of liqueur it receives
completely masks its original character and flavour. This excess of
syrup, it should be remarked, contributes materially to the wine&rsquo;s
explosive force and temporary effervescence; but shortly after the
bottle has been uncorked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the wine becomes disagreeably flat. A fine
dry wine, indebted as it is for its sparkling properties to the natural
sweetness of the grape, does not exhibit the same sudden turbulent
effervescence. It continues to sparkle, however, for a long time after
being poured into the glass, owing to the carbonic acid having been
absorbed by the wine itself instead of being accumulated in the vacant
space between the liquid and the cork, as is the case with wines
that have been highly liqueured. Even when its carbonic acid gas is
exhausted, a good Champagne will preserve its fine flavour, which the
effervescence will have assisted to conceal. Champagne, it should be
noted, sparkles best in tall tapering glasses; still these have their
disadvantages, promoting, as they do, an excess of froth when the wine
is poured into them, and almost preventing any bouquet which the wine
possesses from being recognised.</p>

<p>Manufacturers of Champagne and other sparkling wines prepare them
dry or sweet, light or strong, according to the markets for which
they are designed. The sweet wines go to Russia and Germany&mdash;the
sweet-toothed Muscovite regarding M. Louis Roederer&rsquo;s syrupy product
as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau-idéal</i> of Champagne, and the Germans demanding wines with
twenty or more per cent of liqueur, or nearly quadruple the quantity
that is contained in the average Champagnes shipped to England. France
consumes light and moderately sweet wines; the United States gives a
preference to the intermediate qualities; China, India, and other hot
countries stipulate for light dry wines; while the very strong ones
go to Australia, the Cape, and other places where gold and diamonds
and suchlike trifles are from time to time &lsquo;prospected.&rsquo; Not merely
the driest, but the very best, wines of the best manufacturers, and
commanding of course the highest prices, are invariably reserved for the
English market. Foreigners cannot understand the marked preference shown
in England for exceedingly dry sparkling wines. They do not consider
that as a rule they are drunk during dinner with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plats</i>, and not
at dessert, with all kinds of sweets, fruits, and ices, as is almost
invariably the case abroad.</p>

<p>Good Champagne is usually of a pale straw colour, but with nothing of
a yellow tinge about it. When its tint is pinkish, this is owing to a
portion of the colouring matter having been extracted from the skins
of the grapes&mdash;a contingency which every pains are taken to avoid,
although, since the success achieved by the wine of 1874, slightly pink
wines are likely to be the fashion. The positive pink or rose-coloured
Champagnes, such as were in fashion some thirty years ago, are simply
tinted with a small quantity of deep-red wine. The alcoholic strength of
the drier wines ranges from eighteen degrees of proof spirit upwards,
or slightly above the ordinary Bordeaux, and under all the better-class
Rhine wines. Champagnes, when loaded with a highly alcoholised liqueur,
will, however, at times mark as many as thirty degrees of proof spirit.
The lighter and drier the sparkling wine, the more wholesome it is, the
saccharine element in conjunction with alcohol being not only difficult
of digestion, but generally detrimental to health.</p>

<p>The faculty are agreed that fine dry Champagnes, consumed in moderation,
are among the safest wines that can be partaken of. Any intoxicating
effects are rapid but exceedingly transient, and arise from the alcohol
suspended in the carbonic acid being applied rapidly and extensively
to the surface of the stomach. &lsquo;Champagne,&rsquo; said Curran, &lsquo;simply gives
a runaway rap at a man&rsquo;s head.&rsquo; Dr. Druitt, equally distinguished by
his studies upon wine and his standing as a physician, pronounces
good Champagne to be &lsquo;a true stimulant to body and mind alike&mdash;rapid,
volatile, transitory, and harmless. Amongst the maladies that are
benefited by it,&rsquo; remarks he, &lsquo;is the true neuralgia&mdash;intermitting fits
of excruciating pain running along certain nerves, without inflammation
of the affected part, often a consequence of malaria, or of some other
low and exhausting causes. To enumerate the cases in which Champagne
is of service would be to give a whole nosology. Who does not know the
misery, the helplessness of that abominable ailment influenza, whether
a severe cold or the genuine epidemic? Let the faculty dispute about
the best remedy if they please; but a sensible man with a bottle of
Champagne will beat them all. Moreover, whenever there is pain, with
exhaustion and lowness, then Dr. Champagne should be had up. There is
something excitant in the wine&mdash;doubly so in the sparkling wine, which,
the moment it touches the lips, sends an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
electric telegram of comfort
to every remote nerve. Nothing comforts and rests the stomach better, or
is a greater antidote to nausea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Champagne of fine quality should never be mixed with ice or iced water;
neither should it be iced to the extent Champagnes ordinarily are; for,
in the first place, the natural lightness of the wine is such as not
to admit of its being diluted without utterly spoiling it, and in the
next, excessive cold destroys alike the fragrant bouquet of the wine and
its delicate vinous flavour. Really good Champagne should not be iced
below a temperature of fifty degrees Fahr.; whereas exceedingly sweet
wines will bear icing down almost to freezing point, and be rendered
more palatable by the process. The above remarks apply to all sorts of
sparkling wine.</p>

<p>In the Champagne, what may be termed a really grand vintage commonly
occurs only once, and never more than twice, in ten years. During the
same period, however, there will generally be one or two other tolerably
good vintages. In grand years the crop, besides being of superior
quality, is usually abundant, and as a consequence the price of the raw
wine is scarcely higher than usual. Apparently from this circumstance
the sparkling wine of grand vintages does not command an enhanced value,
as is the case with other fine wines. It is only when speculators
recklessly outbid each other for the grapes or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i>, or when
stocks are low and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> is really scarce, that the price of
Champagne appears to rise.</p>

<p>That superior quality does not involve enhanced price is proved by the
amounts paid for the Ay and Verzenay crus in years of grand vintages.
During the present century these appear to have been 1802, &rsquo;06, &rsquo;11,
&rsquo;18, &rsquo;22, &rsquo;25, &rsquo;34, &rsquo;42, &rsquo;46, &rsquo;57, &rsquo;65, &rsquo;68, and &rsquo;74&mdash;that is, thirteen
grand vintages in eighty years. Other good vintages, although not equal
to the foregoing, occurred in the years 1815, &rsquo;32, &rsquo;39, &rsquo;52, &rsquo;54, &rsquo;58,
&rsquo;62, &rsquo;64, and &rsquo;70. Confining ourselves to the grand years, we find
that the Ay wine of 1834, owing to the crop being plentiful as well as
good, only realised from 110 to 140 francs the pièce of 44 gallons,
although for two years previously this had fetched them 150 to 200
francs. In 1842 the price ranged from 120 to 150 francs, whereas the
vastly inferior wine of the year before had commanded from 210 to 275
francs. In 1846, the crop being a small one, the price of the wine rose,
and in 1857 the pièce fetched as much as from 480 to 500 francs; still
this was merely a trifle higher than it had realised the two preceding
years. In 1865 the price was 380 to 400 francs, and in 1868 about the
same, whereas the indifferent vintages of 1871, &rsquo;72, and &rsquo;73&mdash;the latter
eventually proved to be of execrable quality&mdash;realised from 500 to 1000
francs the pièce. It was very similar with the wine of Verzenay. In
1834 the price of the pièce ranged from 280 to 325 francs, or about the
average of the three preceding years. In 1846, the crop being scarce,
the price rose considerably; while in 1857, when the crop was plentiful,
it fell to 500 francs, or from 5 to 20 per cent below that of the two
previous years, when the yield was both inferior and less abundant.
In 1865 the price rose 33 per cent above that of the year before;
still, although Verzenay wine of 1865 and 1868 fetched from 420 to 450
francs the pièce, and that of 1874 as much as 900 francs, the greatly
inferior vintages of 1872&ndash;73 commanded 900 and 1030 francs the pièce.
Subsequently the price of the wine fell to 350 and 450 francs the pièce,
to rise again, however, in 1878 to 900 francs, which was followed by
a fall the following year to 250 francs. In 1880, when the yield was
no more than the quarter of an average one, and the quality was as yet
undetermined, the Ay and Verzenay wines commanded the high price of
1500 francs and upwards the pièce. Exceptionally high prices were also
realised for the wines of the neighbouring localities.</p>

<p>Consumers of Champagne, if wise, would profit by the circumstance that
quality has not the effect of causing a rise in prices, and if they
were bent upon drinking their favourite wine in perfection, as one
meets with it at the dinner-tables of the principal manufacturers, who
only put old wine of grand vintages before their guests, they would lay
down Champagnes of good years in the same way as the choicer vintages
of port, burgundy, and bordeaux are laid down. The Champagne of 1874
was a wine of this description, with all its finer vinous qualities
well developed, and consequently needing age to attain not merely the
roundness, but the refinement, of flavour pertaining to a high-class
sparkling wine. Instead of being drunk a few months after it was shipped
in the spring and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
summer of 1877, as was the fate of much of the wine
in question, it needed being kept for three years at the very least
to become even moderately round and perfect. In the Champagne one had
many opportunities of tasting the grander vintages that had arrived at
ten, twelve, or fifteen years of age, and had thereby attained supreme
excellence. It is true their effervescence had moderated materially, but
their bouquet and flavour were perfect, and their softness and delicacy
something marvellous.</p>

<p>A great wine like that of 1874 will go on improving for ten years,
providing it is only laid down under proper conditions. These are,
first, an exceedingly cool but perfectly dry cellar, the temperature
of which should be as low as from 50° to 55° Fahr., or even lower if
this is practicable. The cellar, too, should be neither over dark nor
light, scrupulously clean, and sufficiently well ventilated for the
air to be continuously pure. It is requisite that the bottles should
rest on their sides, to prevent the corks shrinking, and thus allowing
both the carbonic acid and the wine itself to escape. For laying down
Champagne or any kind of sparkling wine, an iron wine-bin is by far
the best; and the patent &lsquo;slider&rsquo; bins made by Messrs. W. &amp; J. Burrow,
of Malvern, are better adapted to the purpose than any other. In these
the bottles rest on horizontal parallel bars of wrought-iron, securely
riveted into strong wrought-iron uprights, both at the back and in
front. They are especially adapted for laying down Champagne, as they
admit of the air circulating freely around the bottles, thus conducing
to the preservation of the metal foil round their necks, and keeping the
temperature of the wine both cool and equable.</p>

<p class="bottom3">From the subjoined table it will be seen that the consumption of
Champagne has more than quadrupled since the year 1844&ndash;5, a period of
six-and-thirty years. A curious fact to note is the immense increase
in the exports of the wine during the three years following the
Franco-German war, during which contest both the exports and home
consumption of Champagne naturally fell off very considerably. No
reliable information is available as to the actual quantity of Champagne
consumed yearly in England, but this may be taken in round numbers at
about four millions of bottles. The consumption of the wine in the
United States varies from rather more than a million and a half to
nearly two million bottles annually.</p>

<p>Distinguished gourmets are scarcely agreed as to the proper moment
when Champagne should be introduced at the dinner-table. Dyspeptic Mr.
Walker, of &lsquo;The Original,&rsquo; laid it down that Champagne ought to be
introduced very early at the banquet, without any regard whatever to
the viands it may chance to accompany. &lsquo;Give Champagne,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;at
the beginning of dinner, as its exhilarating qualities serve to start
the guests, after which they will seldom flag. No other wine produces
an equal effect in increasing the success of a party&mdash;it invariably
turns the balance to the favourable side. When Champagne goes rightly,
nothing can well go wrong.&rsquo; These precepts are sound enough; still
all dinner-parties are not necessarily glacial, and the guests are
not invariably mutes. Before Champagne can be properly introduced at
a formal dinner, the conventional glass of sherry or madeira should
supplement the soup, a white French or a Rhine wine accompany the fish,
and a single glass of bordeaux prepare the way with the first <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i>
for the sparkling wine, which, for the first round or two, should be
served briskly and liberally. A wine introduced thus early at the repast
should of course be dry, or, at any rate, moderately so.</p>

<p>We certainly do not approve of Mr. Charles Dickens&rsquo;s dictum that
Champagne&rsquo;s proper place is not at the dinner-table, but solely at a
ball. &lsquo;A cavalier,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;may appropriately offer at propitious
intervals a glass now and then to his danceress. There it takes its
fitting rank and position amongst feathers, gauzes, lace, embroidery,
ribbons, white-satin shoes, and eau-de-Cologne, for Champagne is
simply one of the elegant extras of life.&rsquo; This is all very well;
still the advantageous effect of sparkling wine at an ordinary
British dinner-party, composed as it frequently is of people brought
indiscriminately together in accordance with the exigencies of the
hostess&rsquo;s visiting-list, cannot be gainsaid. After the preliminary
glowering at each other, <em>more Britannico</em>, in the drawing-room,
everybody regards it as a relief to be summoned to the repast, which,
however, commences as chillily as the soup and as stolidly as the
salmon. The soul of the hostess is heavy with the anxiety of prospective
dishes, the brow of the host is clouded with the reflection that our
rulers are bent upon adding an extra penny to the income-tax. Placed
between a young lady just out and a dowager of grimly Gorgonesque
aspect, you hesitate how to open a conversation. Your first attempts are
singularly ineffectual, only eliciting a dropping fire of monosyllables.
You envy the placidly languid young gentleman opposite, limp as his
fast-fading camellia, and seated next to Belle Breloques, who is
certain, in racing parlance, to make the running for him. But even
that damsel seems preoccupied with her fan, and, despite her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aplomb</i>,
hesitates to break the icy silence. The two City friends of the host
are lost in mute speculation as to the future price of indigo or Ionian
Bank shares, while their wives seem to be mentally summarising the exact
cost of each other&rsquo;s toilettes. Their daughters, or somebody else&rsquo;s
daughters, are desperately jerking out monosyllabic responses to feeble
remarks concerning the weather, the theatres, operatic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutantes</i>,
the people in the Row, æstheticism, and kindred topics from a couple of
F.O. men. Little Snapshot, the wit, on the other side of the Gorgon, has
tried to lead up to a story, but has found himself, as it were, frozen
in the bud. When lo! the butler softly sibillates in your ear the magic
word &lsquo;Champagne,&rsquo; and as it flows, creaming and frothing, into your
glass, a change comes over the spirit of your vision.</p>

<p>The hostess brightens, the host coruscates. The young lady on your right
suddenly develops into a charming girl, with becoming appreciation of
your pet topics and an astounding aptness for repartee. The Gorgon
thaws, and implores Mr. Snapshot, whose jests are popping as briskly as
the corks, not to be so dreadfully funny, or he will positively kill
her. Belle Breloques can always talk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and now her tongue rattles faster
then ever, till the languid one arouses himself like a giant refreshed,
and gives her as good as he gets. The City men expatiate in cabalistic
language on the merits of some mysterious speculation, the prospective
returns from which increase with each fresh bottle. One of their wives
is discussing church decoration with a hitherto silent curate, and the
other is jabbering botany to a red-faced warrior. The juniors are in
full swing, and ripples of silvery laughter rise in accompaniment to the
beaded bubbles all round the table.</p>

<p>Gradually, as people drift off from generalities to their own particular
line&mdash;gastronomy, politics, art, sport, fashion, literature, church
matters, theatricals, speculation, scandal, dress, and the like&mdash;the
scraps of sentences that the ear catches flying about the table present
a mosaic somewhat resembling the following: &lsquo;Forster should have sent
him to Kilmainham&mdash;to see that dear delightful Mr. Irving in&mdash;ten-inch
armour-plating, but could not steer in a sea-way, so&mdash;sat down in the
saddle and rammed his spurs into&mdash;Petsy Prettitoes and half a dozen
girls from the Cruralia, who were&mdash;ordained last week by the Bishop of
London, when his lordship&mdash;said there was no doubt who best deserved the
vacant Garter, and declared&mdash;a dividend of seven per cent for the&mdash;comet
year with a bouquet&mdash;of sunflowers and lilies on satin, which you
should&mdash;cover with a light crust&mdash;of stiff clay, with a rasper on the
further side as&mdash;the third story of the hotel overlooking&mdash;the Euphrates
Valley Railway, which would lead to&mdash;the loveliest bit of landscape
in the Academy&mdash;with the finest hair in the world, and eyes like&mdash;a
boiled cod&rsquo;s head and shoulders&mdash;cut low at the neck, with a gold
shoulder-strap, and&mdash;nothing else to speak of before the House except
the Bill for&mdash;her photographs, which are in all the shop-windows, beside
Mrs. Langtry&rsquo;s&mdash;who never ought to have allowed Bismarck to&mdash;assist at
the consecration of&mdash;the Henley course&mdash;so the Duke started at once
for Aldershot, and reviewed&mdash;the two best novels of the season&mdash;cut up
with tomatoes and a dash of garlic&mdash;and was positive he saw them dining
together at Richmond on&mdash;fourteen brace of birds and five hares in&mdash;the
loveliest set of embroidered vestments and an altar-cloth worked for&mdash;a
Conservative majority, which will drive the Government to&mdash;take a couple
of stalls at Her Majesty&rsquo;s to hear <cite>Carmen</cite>&mdash;who gave him the last
galop, but he&mdash;blundered at his first fence and fell&mdash;to seventy-two
and a half, whilst the preference shares were&mdash;all ordered on foreign
service and&mdash;heard nothing from the Irish members but&mdash;Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s
poems bound in red morocco&mdash;with a white-satin train and&mdash;plenty of body
and a good colour&mdash;all through riding every morning in&mdash;a private box
on the upper tier&mdash;and that is why Gladstone at once gave orders&mdash;for
them to be actually shut up together&mdash;in the strong room of the Bank
of England, with a reserve fund of bullion&mdash;from the music in the
first act of <cite>Patience</cite>&mdash;equal to that of Job when he said&mdash;well, only
half a glass, then, since you are so pressing.&rsquo; And all this is due to

<p class="s115 bold sans">MORNING POST.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A Wine for Princes and Senators. The district of Ay has become probably
the most celebrated in the ancient province of Champagne for its grapes,
and among the noted brands of that famed region not one has gained a
greater popularity in this country than that of Deutz &amp; Geldermann.
The Wine of this well-known firm is invariably met with on every
important occasion; and it is noticed that Deutz &amp; Geldermann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gold
Lack&rdquo; was specially selected for the banquet given by the Royal Naval
Club at Portsmouth to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales; and some proof of
its excellence may be gathered from the fact that this brand was drunk
on a former visit of the Prince to the club two years since. Deutz &amp;
Geldermann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gold Lack&rdquo; was one of the Champagnes supplied at the late
Ministerial Whitebait Dinner at the Trafalgar.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="s115 bold sans">WORLD.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Deutz &amp; Geldermann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gold Lack&rdquo; is now being preferred by many
connoisseurs, and we can bear testimony to its excellence of quality.&rsquo;</p>

</a> This arch is said to have been called after the God of
War from the circumstance of a temple dedicated to Mars being in the
immediate neighbourhood. The sculptures still remaining under the
arcades have reference to the months of the year, to Romulus and Remus,
and to Jupiter and Leda. Reims formerly abounded with monuments of the
Roman domination. According to M. Brunette, an architect of the city,
who made its Roman remains his especial study, a vast and magnificent
palace formerly stood nigh the spot now known as the Trois Piliers;
while on the right of the road leading to the town were the arenas,
together with a temple, among the ruins of which various sculptures,
vases, and medals were found, and almost immediately opposite, on the
site of the present cemetery, an immense theatre, circus, and xystos for
athletic exercises. Then came a vast circular space, in the centre of
which arose a grand triumphal arch giving entrance into the city. The
road led straight to the Forum,&mdash;the Place des Marchés of to-day,&mdash;and
along it were a basilica, a market, and an exedra, now replaced by the
Hôtel de Ville. The Forum, bordered by monumental buildings, was of
gigantic proportions, extending on the one side from half way down the
Rue Colbert to the Place Royale, and on the other from near the Marché
à la Laine, parallel with the Rue de Vesle, up to the middle of the Rue
des Elus, where it terminated in a vast amphitheatre used for public
competitions.
</p>
<p>
Other buildings of less importance were situated here and there: the
thermæ along the Rue du Cloître; a palace or a temple on the site of
the archiepiscopal palace; another temple at the extremity of the Rue
Vauthier le Noir, in the ruins of which a bas-relief and some small
antique statues were discovered; a third temple in the Rue du Couchant,
in which a votive altar was found. Four triumphal arches were erected at
the four gates of the town: one dedicated to Mars; another to Ceres, on
the same site as the gate of to-day; a third to Bacchus, in the present
Rue de l&rsquo;Université, in front of the Lycée; and the fourth to Venus,
in the Rue de Vesle. Outside the walls, following the Rue du Barbâtre,
the road was dotted with numerous graves according to the Roman custom;
while on the site of the church of St. Remi there arose a temple and
a palace, and on that of St. Nicaise a vast edifice which M. Brunette
supposed to be the palace of the Consul Jovinus.</p>

</a> According to this document, published in Marlot&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire
de Reims</cite>, he leaves to Bishop Lupus the vineyard cultivated by the
vine-dresser Enias; to his nephew Agricola, the vineyard planted by
Mellaricus at Laon, and also the one cultivated by Bebrimodus; to his
nephew Agathimerus, a vineyard he had himself planted at Vindonisæ,
and kept up by the labour of his own episcopal hands; to Hilaire the
deaconess, the vines adjoining her own vineyard, cultivated by Catusio,
and also those at Talpusciaco; and to the priests and deacons of Reims,
his vineyard in the suburbs of that city, and the vine-dresser Melanius
who cultivated it. The will is also noteworthy for its mention of a
locality destined to attain a high celebrity in connection with the wine
of Champagne, namely, the town of Sparnacus or Epernay, which a lord
named Eulogius, condemned to death for high treason in 499 and saved
at the bishop&rsquo;s intercession, had bestowed upon his benefactor, and
which the latter left in turn to the church of Reims. To this church he
also left estates in the Vosges and beyond the Rhine, on condition of
furnishing pitch every year to the religious houses founded by himself
or his predecessors to mend their wine-vessels, a trace of the old Roman
custom of pitching vessels used for storing wine.</p>

</a> The &lsquo;vin d&rsquo;Ausois,&rsquo; or &lsquo;vin d&rsquo;Aussai&rsquo; (for it is spelt
both ways in the poem), is not, as might be supposed, the wine
of Auxois, an ancient district of Burgundy now comprised in the
arrondissements of Sémur (Côte d&rsquo;Or) and Avallon (Yonne), and still
enjoying a reputation for its viticultural products. MM. J. B. B.
de Roquefort and Gigault de la Bedollière, in their notes on Henri
d&rsquo;Andelys&rsquo; poem, have clearly identified it with the wine of Alsace,
that province having been known under the names in question during the
Middle Ages. This explains its connection in the present instance with
the Moselle.</p>

Pourçain, a wine of the Bourbonnais, very highly esteemed in the Middle
Ages, 12 livres the queue; and the wine of the district, white and red,
6 to 10 livres the queue of two poinçons. A poinçon, or demi-queue,
of Reims was about 48 old English, or 40 imperial, gallons; while the
demi-queue of Burgundy was over 45 imperial gallons.</p>

<a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span>
</a> A few examples of the retail price of wine throughout the
century at Reims may here be noted. For instance, a judgment of 1303
provided that all tavern-keepers selling wine at a higher rate than
six deniers, or about a farthing per lot, the rate fixed by ancient
custom, were to pay a fine of twenty-two sous. The lot or pot, for
the two terms are indifferently used, was about the third of an old
English gallon, four pots making a septier, and thirty-six septiers a
poinçon or demi-queue, equal to about forty-eight gallons. The queue
was therefore about ninety-six gallons at Reims, but at Epernay not
more than eighty-five gallons. Not only had every district its separate
measures,&mdash;those of Paris, for instance, differing widely from those of
Reims,&mdash;but there were actually different measures used in the various
lay and ecclesiastical jurisdictions into which Reims was divided.
</p>
<p>
In the accounts of the Echevinage, wine, chiefly for presents to persons
of distinction, makes a continual appearance. In 1335 it is noted
that &lsquo;the presents of this year were made in wine at 16 deniers and
20 deniers the pot,&rsquo; or about 2&thinsp;&frac14;&thinsp;<i>d.</i> English per gallon. In 1337&ndash;8
prices ranged from &frac34;&thinsp;<i>d.</i> to 4&thinsp;&frac12;&thinsp;<i>d.</i> English per gallon, showing a
variety in quality; and in 1345 large quantities were purchased at the
first-mentioned rate, five quarts of white wine fetching 2&thinsp;<i>d.</i> English.
In 1352 from a 1&thinsp;<i>d.</i> to 2&thinsp;&frac14;&thinsp;<i>d.</i> was paid per gallon, and five crowns
for two queues. In 1363 the citizens, a hot-headed turbulent lot, who
were always squabbling with their spiritual and temporal superior and
assailing his officers, when not assaulting each other or pulling their
neighbours&rsquo; houses down, successfully resisted the pretensions of the
archbishop to regulate the price of wine when the cheapest was worth 12
deniers per pot, or 1&thinsp;&frac12;&thinsp;<i>d.</i> per gallon. The dispute continued, and
in 1367 a royal commission was issued to the bailli of Vermandois, the
king&rsquo;s representative, to inquire into the right of the burghers to
sell wine by retail at 16 deniers, as they desired. The report of the
bailli was that a queue of old French wine being worth about 20 livres,
or 16&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 8&thinsp;<i>d.</i>, and wine of Beaune and other better and stronger wines
being sold in the town at higher rates, French wine might be sold as
high as 3&thinsp;&frac12;&thinsp;<i>d</i>. English per gallon, and Beaune at 4&thinsp;&frac12;&thinsp;<i>d.</i> The great
increase in production, and consequent fall in price, is shown by the
wine found in Archbishop Richard Pique&rsquo;s cellar in 1389 being valued, on
an average, at only 1&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 6&thinsp;<i>d.</i> per queue.</p>

</a> What with one kind of assessment being adopted for wine
sold wholesale and another for that disposed of by retail, with one
class of dues being levied on wine for export and another on that for
home consumption, and with the fact of certain duties being in some
cases payable by the buyer and in others by the seller, any attempt
to summarise this section of the story of the wines of Reims would be
impossible. The difficulty is increased when it is remembered that in
the Middle Ages Reims was divided into districts, under the separate
jurisdictions of the eschevins, the archbishop, the chapter of the
cathedral, the Abbeys of St. Remi and St. Nicaise, and the Priory of
St. Maurice, in several of which widely varying measures were employed
down to the sixteenth century, and between which there were continual
squabbles as to the rights of vinage, rouage, tonnieu, &amp;c.</p>

of red and white wine, nineteen of new red and white wine, and four of
old wine, valued, on an average, at 36 sols or 1&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 6&thinsp;<i>d.</i> the queue;
at Courville there were fifty queues of new wine (valued at 30 sols

wine-making; and at Viellarcy, eighteen tuns of new wine, valued at
60 sols or 2&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 6&thinsp;<i>d.</i> per tun. To take charge of all these, Jehan le

</a> The following is the full text of this singular sentence.
The injunction at the end, respecting the payment of tithes without
fraud, shows that even in a matter like this the Church did not lose
sight of its own interests.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In the name of the Lord, amen. Having seen the prayer or petition on
behalf of the inhabitants of Villenauxe, of the diocese of Troyes, made
before us, official of Troyes, sitting in judgment upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bruhecs</i> or
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éruches</i>, or other similar animals, which, according to the evidence of
persons worthy of belief and as confirmed by public rumour, have ravaged
for a certain number of years, and this year also, the fruit of the
vines of this locality, to the great loss of those who inhabit it and of
the persons of the neighbourhood,&mdash;petition that we warn the above-named
animals, and that, using the means at the Church&rsquo;s disposition, we
force them to retire from the territory of the said place. Having seen
and attentively examined the motives of the prayer or petition above
mentioned, and also the answers and allegations furnished in favour of
the said <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éruches</i> or other animals by the councillors chosen by us for
that purpose; having heard also on the whole our promoter, and seeing
the particular report, furnished at our command by a notary of the
said Court of Troyes, on the damage caused by the said animals amongst
the vines of the locality of Villenauxe already named; though it would
seem that to such damage one can bring no remedy except through the aid
of God; however, taking into consideration the humble, frequent, and
pressing complaint of the above-mentioned inhabitants; having regard,
especially, to the ardour with which, to efface their past great
faults, they lately gave, at our invitation, the edifying spectacle of
solemn prayers; considering that, as the mercy of God does not drive
away the sinners who return to Him with humility, neither should His
Church refuse, to those who run to her, succour or consolation,&mdash;We,
the official above named, no matter how novel the case may be, yielding
to the earnestness of these prayers, following in the footsteps of our
predecessors presiding at our tribunal, having God before our eyes and
full of belief in His mercy and love, after having taken counsel in the
proper quarter, we deliver sentence in the following terms:</p>

<p>&lsquo;In the name and in virtue of the omnipotence of God, of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost; of the blessed Mary, mother of our Lord
Jesus Christ; of the authority of the holy apostles Peter and Paul; and
of that with which we ourselves are invested in this affair, we charge
by this act the above-named animals&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bruches</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éruches</i>, or of any
other name by which they may be called&mdash;to retire (under penalty of
malediction and anathema, within the six days which follow this warning
and in accordance with our sentence) from the vines and from the said
locality of Villenauxe, and never more to cause, in time to come,
any damage, either in this spot or in any other part of the diocese
of Troyes; that if, the six days passed, the said animals have not
fully obeyed our command, the seventh day, in virtue of the power and
authority above mentioned, we pronounce against them by this writing
anathema and malediction! Ordering, however, and formally directing
the said inhabitants of Villenauxe, no matter of what rank, class, or
condition they may be, so as to merit the better from God, all-powerful
dispensator of all good and deliverer from all evil, to be released from
such a great plague; ordering and directing them to deliver themselves
up in concert to good works and pious prayers; to pay, moreover, the
tithe without fraud and according to the custom recognised in the
locality; and to abstain with care from blaspheming and all other
sins, especially from public scandals.&mdash;Signed, N. H<span class="smaller">UPPEROYE</span>,
Secretary.&rsquo;</p>

</a> It has been asserted that the Champagne, and notably
the town of Troyes, enjoyed the dubious honour of furnishing fools to
the court of France. There is certainly a letter of Charles V. to the
notables of Troyes, asking them, &lsquo;according to custom,&rsquo; for a fool to
replace one named Grand Jehan de Troyes, whom he had had buried in the
church of St. Germain l&rsquo;Auxerrois, and who has been immortalised by
Rabelais. But Brusquet was a Provençal; Triboulet, his predecessor,
immortalised by Victor Hugo in the &lsquo;Roi s&rsquo;amuse,&rsquo; a native of Blois;
Chicot the Jester, the fool of Henry III., and the favourite hero of
Dumas, a Gascon; and Guillaume, his successor, a Norman.</p>

was a celebrated builder of Reims. During the last thirty years of the
century the vines seem to have suffered greatly from frost and wet.
Sometimes the wine was so bad that it was sold, as towards the end of
1579, at 5&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 6&thinsp;<i>d.</i> the queue; at others it was so scarce that it rose,
as at the vintage of 1587, to 126&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 8&thinsp;<i>d.</i> the queue. At the vintage
of 1579 the grapes froze on the vines, and were carried to the press
in sacks. At the commencement of the vintage the new wine fetched from
12&thinsp;<i>s.</i> to 16<i>&thinsp;s.</i> the queue, but it turned out so bad that by Christmas
it was sold at 5&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 6&thinsp;<i>d.</i></p>

</a> Lavardin, Bishop of Le Mans, and himself a great
<em>gourmet</em>, was one day at dinner with St. Evremond, and began to rally
the latter on the delicacy of himself and his friends the Marquis
de Bois Dauphin and the Comte d&rsquo;Olonne. &lsquo;These gentlemen,&rsquo; said the
prelate, &lsquo;in seeking refinement in everything carry it to extremes. They
can only eat Normandy veal; their partridges must come from Auvergne,
and their rabbits from La Roche Guyon, or from Versin; they are not
less particular as to fruit; and as to wine, they can only drink that
of the good <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coteaux</i> of Ay, Hautvillers, and Avenay.&rsquo; St. Evremond
having repeated the story, he, the marquis, and the count were nicknamed
&lsquo;the three coteaux.&rsquo; Hence Boileau, in one of his satires, describes an
epicurean guest as &lsquo;profès dans l&rsquo;ordre des coteaux.&rsquo;</p>

</a> St. Evremond&rsquo;s letter to the Comte d&rsquo;Olonne, already
noticed. In another epistle to Lord Galloway, dated 29th August 1701, he
observes: &lsquo;As to M. de Puisieux (Roger Brulart, Marquis de Puisieux et
de Sillery and Governor of Epernay), in my opinion he acts very wisely
in falling in with the bad taste now in fashion as regards Champagne
wine, in order the better to sell his own. I could never have thought
that the wines of Reims could have been changed into wines of Anjou,
from their colour and their harshness (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verdeur</i>). There ought to be a
harshness (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i>) in the wine of Reims, but a harshness with a colour,
which turns into a sprightly tartness (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sêve</i>) when it is ripe; ... and
it is not to be drunk till the end of July.... The wines of Sillery and
Roncières used to be kept two years, and they were admirable, but for
the first four months they were nothing but verjuice. Let M. de Puisieux
make a little barrel (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuve</i>) after the fashion in which it was made
forty years ago, before this depravity of taste, and send it to you.&rsquo;

</a> The following account of Dom Perignon and his discoveries
is contained in a letter dated 25th October 1821, and addressed from
Montier-en-Der, Haute Marne, to M. Dherbès of Ay, by Dom Grossart, the
last procureur of the Abbey of Hautvillers. Dom Grossart, who had fled
from France during the troublous times of the Revolution, was at the
date of the letter in his seventy-fourth year.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;You know, sir, that it was the famous Dom Perignon, who was procureur
of Hautvillers for forty-seven years, and who died in 1715, who
discovered the secret of making sparkling and non-sparkling white
wine, and the means of clearing it without being obliged to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépoter</i>
the bottles, as is done by our great wine-merchants rather twice than
once, and by us never. Before his time one only knew how to make
straw-coloured or gray wine. In bottling wine, instead of corks of
cork-wood, only tow was made use of, and this species of stopper was
saturated with oil. It was in the marriage of our wines that their
goodness consisted; and this Dom Perignon towards the end of his days
became blind. He had instructed in his secret of fining the wines (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de
coller les vins</i>) a certain Brother Philip, who was for fifty years
at the head of the wines of Hautvillers, and who was held in such
consideration by M. Le Tellier, Archbishop of Reims, that when this
brother went to Reims he made him come and sit at table with him. When
the vintage drew near, he (Dom Perignon) said to this brother, &ldquo;Go and
bring me some grapes from the Prières, the Côtes-à-bras, the Barillets,
the Quartiers, the Clos Sainte Hélène,&rdquo; &amp;c. Without being told from
which vineyard these grapes came, he mentioned it, and added, &ldquo;the wine
of such a vineyard must be married with that of such another,&rdquo; and
never made a mistake. To this Brother Philip succeeded a Brother André
Lemaire, who was for nearly forty years at the head of the cellars of
Hautvillers, that is to say, until the Revolution.... This brother being
very ill, and believing himself on the point of death, confided to me
the secret of clarifying the wines, for neither prior nor procureur nor
monk ever knew it. I declare to you, sir, that we never did put sugar in
our wines; you can attest this when you find yourself in company where
it is spoken of.
</p>
<p>
Monsieur Moët, who has become one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gros bonnets</i> of Champagne
since 1794, when I used to sell him plenty of little baskets, will not
tell you that I put sugar in our wines. I make use of it at present
upon some white wines which are vintaged in certain <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crûs</i> of our wine
district. This may have led to the error.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;As it costs much to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépoter</i>, I am greatly surprised that no
wine-merchant has as yet taken steps to learn the secret of clearing the
wine without having to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépoter</i> the bottles when once the wine has been
put into them.&rsquo;</p>

</a> Ibid. Pluche, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Spectacle de la Nature</cite>, 1732,
also says: &lsquo;If the wine be drawn off towards the end of March, when
the sap begins to rise in the vine, it will froth to such a degree as
to whiten like milk, to the very bottom of the glass, the moment it is
poured out. Wine will sometimes acquire this quality if it be drawn off
during the ascent of the sap in August, which makes it evident that the
froth is occasioned by the operation of the air and sap, which then
act with vigour in the wood of the vine, and likewise in the liquor it
produced. This violent ebulition, which is so agreeable to some persons,
is thought by connoisseurs to be inconsistent with the goodness of the
wine, since the greenest may be made to whiten into a froth, and the
most perfect wines seldom discover this quality.&rsquo; In an article in the
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Verdun</cite> of November 1726, the following passage occurs: &lsquo;A
wine merchant of Anjou having written some time back to a celebrated
magistrate in Champagne, Bertin du Rocheret, begging him to forward
the secret of making <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> during the vintage, the magistrate
answered, &ldquo;That <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> was not made during the vintage; that
there was no special soil for it; that the Anjou wines were suitable,
since poor wine froths as well as the most excellent, frothing being a
property of thin poor wine. That to make wine froth, it was necessary to
draw it off as clear as could be done from the lees, if it had not been
already racked; to bottle it on a fine clear day in January or February,
or in March at the latest; three or four months afterwards the wine will
be found effervescent, especially if it has some tartness and a little
strength. When the wine works (like the vine) your wine will effervesce
more than usual; a taste of vintage and of fermentation will be found
in it.&rdquo; The excellent wines of Ay and our good Champagne wines do not
froth, or very slightly; they content themselves with sparkling in the
glass.&rsquo;</p>

of his of the 20th December 1705, asking for &lsquo;two quartaux of the most
excellent vin de Champagne, and a pièce of good for ordinary drinking,&rsquo;
Bertin has written, &lsquo;I will send you, as soon as the river, which is
strongly flooded, becomes navigable, the wine you ask for, and you will
be pleased with it; but as the best new wine is not of a quality to
be drunk in all its goodness by the spring, I should think that fifty
flasks of old wine, the most exquisite in the kingdom that I can furnish
you with, together with fifty other good ones, will suit you instead of

from the juice allowed to drain from grapes slightly trodden, but not
pressed. It had a flavour of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verdeur</i>, which was regarded as one of
its chief merits, and would not keep more than six months. Though at

</a> Ample details of the systems of viticulture and
wine-making pursued in the Champagne at the commencement of the
eighteenth century are to be found in the anonymous <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire</cite> published
in 1718. These are reproduced to a great extent in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Spectacle de la
Nature</cite> of Noel Antoine Pluche, a native of Reims, who composed this
work (published in 1732) for the benefit of the son of Lord Stafford, to
whom he was tutor. The Abbé Pluche, after being professor of humanity
and rhetoric at the University of Reims, was about to enter into holy
orders, but being denounced as an opponent of the Bull Unigenitus,
abandoned all ideas of preferment, and devoted himself to private
tuition and the composition of his great work, the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Spectacle de la
Nature</cite>. This last is a perfect encyclopædia, in the form of a series
of dialogues, recalling those in Mrs. Barbauld&rsquo;s <cite>Evenings at Home</cite>,
the interlocutors being the Count, the Countess, the Chevalier, and the
Prior; and the style may be best judged from the following extracts from
the contemporary translation of Mr. Samuel Humphries.
</p>
<p>
In Dialogue XIII. on &lsquo;Vines,&rsquo; the Count remarks that, after studying
the methods of viticulture followed in different provinces, he &lsquo;could
not discover any to be ranked in Competition with those Precautions
that have been taken by the Inhabitants of Champaign&rsquo; in the production
of their wine. By &lsquo;a long Course of Experience&rsquo; they had &lsquo;acquired the
proper Method of tinging it with the Complexion of a Cherry, or the Eye
of a Partridge. They could likewise brighten it into the whitest Hue, or
deepen it into a perfect Red.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
In the succeeding Dialogue on &lsquo;Wines,&rsquo; the Count states that &lsquo;Vines
vary in their Qualities. Some are planted in a very light and strong
Soil, and they yield a bright and fragrant Wine; others are placed in
a more nourishing Tract of Land, and they produce a Wine of a greater
Body. The reasonable Combination of these different Fruits will produce
an exquisite Liquor, that will have all the Advantages of a sufficient
Body, a Delicacy of Flavour, a Fragrancy of Scent, and a Liveliness
of Colour, and which may be Kept for several Years without the least
Alteration. It was the Knowledge of those Effects that result from
intermixing the Grapes of three or four Vines of different Qualities,
which improved the celebrated Wines of Sillery, Ai, and Hautvillers to
the Perfection they have now acquired. Father Parignon, a Benedictine of
Hautvillers on the Marne, was the first who made any successful Attempt
to intermix the Grapes of the different Vines in this manner, and the
Wine of Perignon d&rsquo;Hautvillers bore the greatest Estimation amongst us
till the Practise of this Method became more extensive.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
The Count notes that white wines from white grapes being deficient
in strength, and apt to grow yellow and degenerate before the next
return of summer, had gone out of repute, except for some medicinal
prescriptions, whilst &lsquo;the grey Wine, which has so bright an Eye and
resembles the Complexion of Crystal, is produced by the blackest
Grapes.&rsquo; &lsquo;The Wine of a black Grape may be tinged with any Colour we
think proper; those who desire to have it perfectly White have recourse
to the following Method. The People employed in the Vintage begin their
Labours at an early Hour in the Morning; and when they have selected
the finest Grapes, they lay them gently in their Baskets, in order to
be carried out of the Vineyard; or they place them in large Panniers,
without pressing them in the least or wiping off the dewy Moisture
or the azure Dye that covers them. Dews and exhaling Mists greatly
contribute to the Whiteness of the Wine. &rsquo;Tis customary to cover the
Baskets with wet Cloths in a hot Sunshine, because the Liquor will be
apt to assume a red Tincture if the Grapes should happen to be heated.
These Baskets are then placed on the Backs of such Animals as are of
a gentle Nature, and carry their Burdens with an easy Motion to the
Cellar, where the Grapes continue covered in a cool Air. When the
Warmth of the Sun proves moderate, the Labours of the Vintage are not
discontinued till Eleven in the Morning; but a glowing Heat makes it
necessary for them to cease at Nine.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
Yet even these precautions were liable to fail, since &lsquo;the Heat of
the Sun and the Shocks of the Carriages are sometimes so violent, and
produce such strong Effects upon the exterior Coat of the Grapes,
that the Fluids contained in that Coat, and which are then in Motion,
mix themselves with the Juice of the Pulp at the first Pressing; in
consequence of which, the Extraction of a Wine perfectly white is
rendered impracticable, and its Colour will resemble the Eye of a
Partridge, or perhaps some deeper Hue. The Quality of the Wine is still
the same; but it must be either entirely White or Red, in order to prove
agreeable to the Taste and Mode which now prevail.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
The Count describes the two pressings and five cuttings, the latter term
derived from the squaring of the mass of grapes with the cutting peel,
and the system of &lsquo;glewing&rsquo; this wine, &lsquo;the weight of an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ecu d&rsquo;or</i>&rsquo; of
&lsquo;Fish Glew, which the Dutch import amongst us from Archangel,&rsquo; being
added to each <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce</i>, with the addition sometimes of a pint of spirits
of wine or brandy. He then explains the method practised of drawing
off the wine without disturbing the barrels, by the aid of a tube and
a gigantic pair of bellows. The vessels were connected by the former,
and the wine then driven from one to the other by the pressure of air
pumped in by means of the latter. A sulphur-match was burnt in the
empty vessels, so that it might &lsquo;receive a Steam of Spirits capable of
promoting the natural Fire and bright Complexion of the Liquor.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
Noting that the wines should be again &lsquo;glewed&rsquo; eight days before they
are bottled, Pluche says: &lsquo;The Month of March is the usual Season
for glewing the most tender Wines, such as those of Ai, Epernai,
Hautvilliers, and Pieri, whose chief Consumption is in France; but
this Operation should not be performed on such strong Wines as those
of Sillery, Verzenai, and other Mountain Wines of Reims, till they
are twelve Months old, at which Time they are capable of supporting
themselves for several Years. When these Wines are bottled off before
they have exhaled their impetuous Particles, they burst a Number of
Bottles, and are less perfect in their Qualities. The proper Method
of bottling Wine consists in leaving the Space of a Finger&rsquo;s Breadth
between the Cork and the Liquor, and in binding the Cork down with
Packthread; it will also be proper to seal the Mouths of the Bottles
with Wax, to prevent Mistakes and Impositions. The Bottles should
likewise be reclined on one Side, because if they are placed in an
upright Position, the Corks will grow dry in a few Months for want of
Moisture, and shrink from their first Dimensions. In Consequence of
which a Passage will be opened to the external Air, which will then
impart an Acidity to the Wine, and form a white Flower on the Surface,
which will be an Evidence of its Corruption.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire</cite> of 1718 also points out the necessity of leaving a space
between the cork and the wine, saying that without this, when the wine
began to work at the different seasons of the year, it would break a
large number of bottles; and that even despite this precaution large
numbers are broken, especially when the wine is a little green. The
ordinary bottles for Champagne, styled <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flacons</i>, or flasks, held &lsquo;a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pinte de Paris</i>, less half a glass,&rsquo; and cost from 12 to 15 francs the
hundred; and as wood abounded in the province, several glass-works were
established there for their manufacture. As the bottling of the wine,
especially in the early years, was mostly to order, many customers had
their flasks stamped with their arms, at a cost of about 30 per cent
more. The corks&mdash;&lsquo;solid, even, and not worm-eaten&rsquo;&mdash;cost from 50 to 60
sols per hundred. Wire was as yet quite unknown. The cost of bottling a
poinçon of wine in 1712 was: for 200 bottles, 30 livres; 200 corks, 3
livres; 2 baskets and packing, 8 livres; bottling, string, and sealing,
3 livres; total, 44 livres, or say 36 shillings.
</p>
<p>
It would appear from the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire</cite> that the pernicious practice of
icing still Champagne, already noticed, continued in vogue as regards
sparkling wine. The wine was recommended to be taken out of the cellar
half an hour before it was intended it should be drunk, and put into
a bucket of water with two or three pounds of ice. The bottle had to
be previously uncorked, and the cork lightly replaced, otherwise it
was believed there was danger of the bottle breaking. A short half an
hour in the ice was said to bring out the goodness of the wine. Bertin
du Rocheret counselled the use of ice to develop the real merits of a
vinous wine of Ay.</p>

</a> Champagne has been accused of producing not only gout,
but stone, gravel, and rheumatism. As to the first-named complaint,
Bertin du Rocheret disposes of it by noting, in a list compiled by him
of all the deaths of any moment at Epernay, from 1644 downwards, the
decease, at the age of seventy-five, on January 1, 1733, of Jeanne
Maillard, &lsquo;the only person in the district ever attacked by the gout.&rsquo;
His brother-in-law, Dr. Jacques de Reims, in a letter to Helvetius
in 1730, asserts that this complaint is only known by name in the
Champagne; and that, as regards the stone, not more than ten people
were affected therewith within a radius of ten leagues. He maintained
that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non-mousseux</i> white wine of the Champagne, drunk at maturity
and tempered with water, was the best of all beverages for preserving
general health; and the eminent Dr. Camille Falconnet held the same
opinion. Arthur Young, moreover, furnishes spontaneous testimony with
regard to rheumatism. Extolling the sparkling wine of Reims in 1787,
he says, &lsquo;I suppose fixed air is good for the rheumatism; I had some
writhes of it before I entered Champagne, but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin mousseux</i> has
absolutely banished it;&rsquo; and on reaching Ove, he regrets that &lsquo;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
de Champagne</i>, which is forty sous at Reims, is three livres here, and
execrably bad; so there is an end of my physic for the rheumatism&rsquo;
(<cite>Travels in France in 1787&ndash;9</cite>).</p></div>

</a> &lsquo;With what vivacity,&rsquo; he exclaims, with a strange
blending of poetry and science, &lsquo;does this divine liquid burst forth
in sparkling foam-bells! And what an agreeable impression it produces
upon the olfactory organs! What a delicious sensation it creates upon
the delicate fibres of the palate! ... It is fixed air which, by its
impetuous motion, forms and raises up that foam, the whiteness of which,
rivalling that of milk, soon offers to our astonished eye the lustre of
the most transparent crystal. It is this same air that, by its expansion
and the effervescence it produces, develops the action of the vinous
spirit of which it is the vehicle, in order that the <i>papillæ</i> of the
nerves may more promptly receive the delicious impression.... Vainly
calumny spreads the report on all sides that the sparkle of our wines
is injurious; vainly it asserts that they have only a hurtful fire and
a worthless flavour. Incapable of hiding under an insidious appearance
a perfidious venom, they will always present a faithful image of the
ingenuousness of their native province.&rsquo;</p>

</a> Henderson&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">History of Ancient and Modern Wines</cite>.
Pluche, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Spectacle de la Nature</cite>, notices the controversy
regarding the respective merits of the wines of the Marne and the Côte
d&rsquo;Or in the following terms:
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>&lsquo;Count</em>: If we will be determined by the finest palates, the Champaign
wine is much preferable to Burgundy.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>Prior</em>: It is a sufficient honour for Champaign to be admitted to the
same degree of estimation with Burgundy; and it may very well dispense
with the priority. I always thought Burgundy had some similitude with
a solid understanding, which affects us with lasting impressions, and
that Champaign resembles a lively wit, which glitters more upon the
imagination, but which is not always serviceable to its possessor.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>Count</em>: If you had made the froth of some Champaign wines and the
sallies of a sprightly wit your parallel, I should have thought it
unexceptionable; and several pleasant remarks might be made on this
sprightliness without solidity. But such a Champaign wine as that of
Sillery unites all the vigour of Burgundy, with an agreeable flavour
peculiar to itself.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>Prior</em>: I prefer useful qualities to those that are merely agreeable.
Burgundy seems to be a more salutary wine than Champaign, and will
always be triumphant for that reason. Its colour alone declares it to be
a wine of a good body, and I must confess I am apt to be diffident of
all dazzling appearances.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>Count</em>: People believe that this deep colour, so esteemed in Burgundy
wines, is an indication of their wholesomeness; but it is observable in
the grossest wines, and results from an intermixture of the husky parts
of the grape. Wine, in proportion to the quantity of these particles
blended with it, will be less qualified for digestion. The gout,
therefore, and the stone, with which the inhabitants of wine-countries
are so frequently afflicted, are distempers hardly known either at
Reims or on the banks of the Marne, where the wines are very moderately
coloured.... Wines may be made almost as white in Burgundy as they are
in Champaign, though not so good; and, on the other hand, the Champenois
press a wine as red as the Burgundy growth, and the merchants sell it
either as the best species of Burgundy to the wine-conners, who are
the first people that are deceived in it, or as red Champaign to the
connoisseurs, who prefer it to any other wine. If we may judge of the
merit of wines by the price, we shall certainly assign the preference to
Champaign, since the finest species of this wine is sold in the vaults
of Sillery and Epernai for six, seven, or eight hundred livres, when the
same quality of the best Burgundy may be purchased for three hundred.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em>Countess</em>: Let me entreat you, gentlemen, to leave this controversy
undecided. The equal pretensions that are formed by these two great
provinces promote an emulation which is advantageous to us. The
partisans for Burgundy and Champaign form two factions in the State; but
their contests are very entertaining, and their encounters not at all
dangerous. It is very usual to see the zealots of one party maintaining
a correspondence with those of the other; they frequently associate
together without any reserve, and those who were advocates for Burgundy
at the beginning of the entertainment are generally reconciled to
Champaign before the appearance of the dessert.&rsquo;</p>

</a> A curious proof of the popularity of sparkling Champagne,
and of the singular system of provincial government into which France
was broken up during the reign of Louis XV., is found in a decree of the
Council of State, dated May 25, 1728. The decree in question begins by
setting forth that, by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ordonnance des aides de Normandie</i>, wine was
forbidden to be brought into Rouen or its suburbs in bottles, jugs, or
any less vessels than hogsheads and barrels&mdash;with the exception of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
de liqueur</i> packed in boxes&mdash;under pain of confiscation and one hundred
livres&rsquo; fine, and that carriers were prohibited from conveying wine in
bottles in the province without leave from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermier des aides</i>.
Nevertheless, petitions had been presented by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maire</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échevins</i>
of Reims, stating &lsquo;that the trade in the gray wines of Champagne had
considerably increased for some years past, through the precautions
taken at the place of production to bottle them during the first moon
of the month of March following the vintage, in order to render them
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>; that those who make use of the gray wine of Champagne prefer
that which is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i> to that which is not; and that this gray wine
cannot be transported in casks into the interior of the kingdom or to
foreign countries without totally losing its qualities,&rsquo;&mdash;a statement
probably intentionally overdrawn, since Bertin du Rocheret used to
export it in casks to England. Yet the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermiers des aides de Normandie</i>
claimed to prohibit the transport of wines in bottle; and if their
pretension held good, the trade in the gray wine of Champagne would
be destroyed. &lsquo;Shifting the cause, as a lawyer knows how,&rsquo; the decree
recapitulates the plea of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermiers</i> that the transport of wine in
bottles offered facilities for defrauding the revenue, since a carrier
with a load could easily leave some of it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> with innkeepers,
and these in turn could hide bottles holding a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pinte de Paris</i> from the
officers in chests, cupboards, &amp;c., and sell them subsequently, to the
detriment of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droits de détail</i>.
</p>
<p>
The foregoing duly rehearsed, there follows the decree permitting &lsquo;to
be sent in bottles into the province of Normandy, for the consumption
of the said province, gray wine of Champagne in baskets, which must not
hold less than one hundred bottles,&rsquo; but prohibiting the introduction
in bottles of any other growth or quality, under the penalty of
confiscation and one hundred livres&rsquo; fine. Permission is also given to
pass gray and red wine of Champagne, or of any other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cru</i> or quality,
in baskets of fifty or one hundred bottles for conveyance into other
provinces, or for shipment to foreign parts by the ports of Rouen, Caen,
Dieppe, and Havre. The wagoners, however, in all cases are to have
certificates signed and countersigned by all manner of authorities,
and are only to enter the province by certain specified routes. All
wine, too, is to pay the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit de détail</i>, except in the case of
people not continuously residing in the province, who may be going to
their estates, or those bound for the eaux de Forges, a celebrated
watering-place, both of whom may take a certain quantity in bottle with
them for their own consumption free of duty.</p>

</a> Amongst these may be cited the Abbé Bignon, who, in a
letter to Bertin du Rocheret dated January 1734, says: &lsquo;The less the
wine is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i> and glittering, and the more, on the contrary, it
shows at the outset of what you style <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liqueur</i>, and I, in chemical
terms, should rather call balsamic parts, the better I shall think of
it.&rsquo;</p></div>

furnishes some interesting details respecting Mademoiselle de Navarre,
who, after being the mistress of Marshal Saxe, married the Chevalier de
Mirabeau, brother to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ami des Hommes</i> and uncle of the celebrated
orator, and then goes on to say: &lsquo;In the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries the wines of Avenay shared with those of Hautvillers the
glory of rivalling the best of Ay. &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avenay, les bons raisins</i>,&rdquo; was
the popular saying inscribed on the banner of its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaliers de
l&rsquo;Arquebuse</i> (a corps of local sharpshooters). La Bruyère, St. Evremond,
Boileau himself, Coulanges, L&rsquo;Atteignant, and many others had celebrated
the tender and delicate wines of our vineyards; and that of Madame
l&rsquo;Abbesse especially had acquired such a reputation, that several great
families, strangers to the locality, thought it the right thing to
have a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vendangeoir</i> at Avenay, and to pass part of the autumn in the
renowned Val d&rsquo;Or.&rsquo;</p>

</a> M. Sutaine observes that in 1780 a merchant of Epernay
bottled 6000 bottles, and that the importance of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirage</i> was noted
as something remarkable; and this statement has been repeated by every
other writer on Champagne. Yet here is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirage</i> of 6000 bottles taking
place thirty-four years previously. The extent of the bottled-wine trade
is confirmed by Arthur Young, who in 1787 visited Ay, where M. Lasnier
had 60,000 bottles in his cellar, and M. Dorsé from 30,000 to 40,000.
Marmontel in 1716 mentions Henin de Navarre&rsquo;s cellars at Avenay as
containing 50,000 bottles of Champagne.</p>

Bignon confirms this in a letter of December 20, 1736, to Bertin du
Rocheret, respecting wine received from him. &lsquo;The wine sealed with a
cipher in red wax,&rsquo; he observes, &lsquo;seemed to me very delicate, but having
as yet some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liqueur</i> which time may get rid of, though after that I
am afraid there will not remain much strength. Another, also sealed
with red wax, but with a coat-of-arms, seems to have more quality and
vinosity, though also very delicate and very light, both <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sablant</i>
perfectly, though they cannot be called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i>. As to that which
is sealed with black, the people who esteem foam would bestow the most
magnificent eulogies upon it. It would be difficult to find any that
carries this beautiful perfection further. Three spoonfuls at the bottom
of the glass is surmounted with the strongest foam to the very brim; on
the other hand, I found in it a furious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i>, and not much vinosity.&rsquo;</p></div>

to the Marquis de Polignac both <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petillant</i>. In 1736 he
offers M. Véron de Bussy his choice of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mousseux</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mousseux</i>,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saute bouchon</i>; and the following year distinguishes his Ay

</a> Respecting the price of sparkling Champagne during
the first half of the eighteenth century, a few instances from the
correspondence of Bertin du Rocheret may here he quoted. In 1716 he
offers Marshal d&rsquo;Artagnan 1500 bottles at 35 sols, cash down, and taken
at Epernay. In 1725 he offers <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flacons blancs mousseux liqueur</i> at from
30 to 50 sols, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ambrés non mousseux, sablant</i>, at 25 sols. Ten years
later <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saute bouchon</i> is quoted by him at 40 and 45 sols, and in 1736 at
3 livres, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mousseux</i> ranging from 36 to 40 sols, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mousseux</i>
from 45 to 50 sols. The following year <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saute bouchon</i> fetched 3 livres
6 sols, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseux</i> 42 sols. In 1736 he insisted upon his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flacons</i>
holding a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pinte</i>; and a royal decree of March 8, 1755, which regulated
the weight and capacity of sparkling-wine bottles, required these to
weigh 25 ounces, and to hold a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pinte de Paris</i>, or about 1.64 imperial
pint. They were, moreover, to be tied crosswise on the top of the cork,
with a string of three strands well twisted. Their cost was 15 livres
per hundred in 1734 and 1738, and from 17 to 19 livres in 1754.</p>

thesis in favour of Champagne, written by Dr. Xavier of Reims in 1777,
the acidulous character of the wine is confirmed by the author, who
naïvely remarks that it is as efficacious in preventing putrefaction as
are other acids. He also compares it to acidulated waters.</p>

</a> The gifts presented by the municipality on this occasion
included flowers, pears, and gingerbread, Reims being as famed for the
latter as for its wines. The guild of gingerbread-makers at Reims was
established in the sixteenth century, and from that time forward was
engaged in continual squabbles with the bakers and pastrycooks of the
city, who could not be brought to understand that they had not the right
to make gingerbread. Countless reams of paper were scribbled over by
the lawyers of the two contending interests; but though the Bailli of
Reims on several occasions pronounced a formal verdict, to the effect
that no one but a sworn and accepted gingerbread-maker should have act
or part in the making of the indigestible delicacy, the contumacious
bakers continued to treat his edicts as naught. Eventually a royal edict
of 1776, which suppressed the privileges of the majority of the guilds
in France, deprived the Reims gingerbread-makers for ever of the right
of figuring with swords by their sides and three-cornered hats on their
heads at all local ceremonies, civil or religious, and threw their trade
open to all.

It was at the close of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s reign that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pain d&rsquo;épice</i>
of Reims reached the summit of its renown. At the coronation of his
successor, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échevins</i> of Reims presented the monarch with several
baskets of it; and when Maria Leczinska passed through Reims in
January 1725, the notables offered her twelve wicker baskets, covered
with damask and ornamented with ribbons, containing fresh and dried
pears, conserves, preserved lemons, almond-cakes, and a new kind of
gingerbread, which received the name of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonnette à la Reine</i>.</p>

</a> This escutcheon shows the arms of Reims, which at
first consisted of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rinçeaux</i> or branches; subsequently a cross and a
crozier, placed saltire-wise, and a sainte Ampoule, were added. When
the government of the city passed from the archbishop, the entwined
olive-branches and chief strewn with fleurs de lis were adopted, the old
motto, &lsquo;Dieu en soit garde,&rsquo; being retained. The iron gates of the Porte
de Paris were removed to their present position in 1843, to allow of the
passage of the canal.</p>

<p class="caption">LE GOURMAND: AN INCIDENT OF LOUIS XVI.&rsquo;S FLIGHT FROM PARIS<br />
(From a caricature of the period).</p>

</div>

<p>
This caricature, which is neither signed nor dated, is simply entitled
&lsquo;Le Gourmand;&rsquo; though Jaime, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Caricature</cite>, states
that it represents Louis XVI. at Varennes. According to Carlyle,
however, the king reached Varennes at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, was at
once arrested in his carriage, and taken to Procureur Sausse&rsquo;s house.
Here he &lsquo;demands refreshments, as is written; gets bread-and-cheese,
with a bottle of Burgundy, and remarks that it is the best Burgundy he
ever drunk.&rsquo; At six o&rsquo;clock the following morning he left Varennes,
escorted by ten thousand National Guards. Very likely there may have
been a story current at the time to the effect that the arrest was due
to the king&rsquo;s halting to gratify his appetite. Or the caricature may
represent some incident that occurred, during his return to Paris, as he
passed through the Champagne district, and halted at the Hôtel de Rohan
at Epernay.</p>

</a> Writing to Sir Walter Mildmay in 1569, the Earl of
Shrewsbury, who had charge of the royal prisoner, complains that his
regular allowance of wine duty free is not enough. &lsquo;The expenses I
have to bear this year on account of the Queen of the Scots are so
considerable as to compel me to beg you will kindly consider them. In
fact, two butts of wine a month hardly serve for our ordinary use; and
besides this, I have to supply what is required by the Princess for her
baths and similar uses.&rsquo;</p>

</a> This wine, though sometimes sent by way of Dunkirk,
was usually forwarded <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Calais, by the intermediary of a Sieur
Labertauche, a commission-agent at that port, the cost of transport from
Epernay to Calais being from 70 to 75 livres per queue. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bobillon</i>
of wine was sent with each lot of casks for filling up. Moreover, from
1731 Bertin annually despatches a certain quantity of cream of tartar,
destined to cure the ropiness to which all white wines were especially
subject before the discovery that tannin destroys the principle
engendering this disease.</p>

</a> Ms. correspondence of Bertin du Rocheret, quoted by M.
Louis Perrier in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire sur le Vin de Champagne</cite>. M. Perrier
states that the prohibition was removed by an act of the 1st Nov.
1745; and a letter of Bertin to Chabane, the following year, bears
this out. It is therefore singular to find the following entry in Bubb
Doddington&rsquo;s <cite>Diary</cite>, under the date of Feb. 1, 1753: &lsquo;Went to the House
to vote for liberty to import Champaign in bottles. Lord Hillsborough
moved it; Mr. Fox seconded it. We lost the Motion. Ayes, 74; Noes, 141.&rsquo;</p>

was supplied with 120 bottles of the vintage of 1788; Manning, of the

at 3 livres or 2&thinsp;<i>s.</i> the bottle, to be delivered in the autumn by M.
Caurette; Messrs. Felix Calvert &amp; Sylvin, who took two sample bottles at
5&thinsp;<i>s.</i>; and Mr. Lockhart, banker, of 36 Pall Mall, who in 1790 paid 3&thinsp;<i>s.</i>
per bottle for 360 bottles of the vintage of 1788. The high rate of
exchange in our favour is shown by the 54&thinsp;<i>l.</i> covering this transaction

Henderson, who appears to have visited the Champagne in 1822, remarks
of the remaining <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crûs</i> of the province: &lsquo;The wines of the neighbouring
territories of Mareuil and Dizy are of similar quality to those of Ay,
and are often sold as such. Those of Hautvillers, on the other hand,
which formerly equalled, if not surpassed, the growths just named, have
been declining in repute since the suppression of the monastery, to
which the principal vineyard belonged.&rsquo;</p>

</a> According to recent statistics issued by the Chamber of
Commerce of Reims, the department of the Marne contains 16,500 hectares
of vineyards (40,755 acres), of which 2465 hectares are situated in the
district of Vitry-le-François; 555 hectares in that of Châlons; 700 in
that of Sainte Menehould; 7624 in that of Reims; and 5587 in the Epernay
district, where the finest qualities of Champagne are grown. The value
of the wine produced annually in these districts exceeds 60,000,000
francs (nearly 2&thinsp;&frac12; millions sterling). During the last thirty years,
the value of these vineyards has increased fourfold. The &lsquo;population
vigneronne&rsquo; of the department is 16,093 inhabitants.</p>

</a> The blending of black and white grapes together, although
its advantages had been recognised in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Rustique</cite> of 1574,
appears not to have been successfully carried out at Ay till the days
of Dom Perignon. &lsquo;Formerly,&rsquo; remarks Pluche, &lsquo;it was very difficult to
preserve the wine of Ay longer than one year. When the juice of the
white grapes, whose quantity was very great in that vineyard, began to
assume a yellowish hue, it became predominant, and created a change in
all the wine; but ever since the white grapes have been disused, the
Marne wines may be easily kept for the space of four or five years&rsquo;
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Spectacle de la Nature</cite>, 1732).</p>

</a> From time immemorial the vineyards of Ay and Dizy paid
tithes to the Abbey of Hautvillers, the former a sixtieth and the
latter an eleventh of their produce. These dues were, by a decree of
1670, levied at the gate of Ay. In 1772, Tirant de Flavigny, a large
wine-grower, who farmed, amongst other vineyards, &lsquo;Les Quartiers&rsquo; at
Hautvillers, insisted on leaving the tithe of grapes at the foot of the
vine for collection by the abbey tithe-collectors. The Abbot Alexandre
Ange de Talleyrand Périgord refused to accept them, and insisted in
turn that the whole of the grapes should either be brought to the gate
of Hautvillers or converted into wine in the vineyard, and the eleventh
part of this wine handed to his representative. From a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès verbal</i>
drawn up by the Mayor of Ay, it seems that the inhabitants were willing
to pay a monetary commutation, as was the prevailing custom, or to leave
the abbot&rsquo;s share of grapes in the vineyards; but objected to the tithe
being taken, usually with considerable delay, on each basket, whereby
the remaining grapes were bruised, and the possibility of bright white
wine being made from them rendered exceedingly doubtful. It was not till
1787 that it was finally settled that the tithes should be paid in money
at the rate of so much per arpent, and it is plain that the abbot&rsquo;s
chief object was to throw as much difficulty as he could in the way of
rival makers of fine wines.</p>

</a> The yield from the Ay vineyards averages five pièces, or
220 gallons per acre. Arthur Young, writing in 1787, estimated that the
arpent (rather more than the acre) produced from two to six pièces of
wine, or an average of four pièces, two of which sold for 200 livres,
one for 150 livres, and one for 50 livres. He valued the arpent of vines
at from 3000 to 6000 livres. Henderson, in his <cite>History of Ancient and
Modern Wines</cite>, says that in 1822 there were a thousand arpents on the
hill immediately behind the village of Ay valued at from 10,000 to
12,000 francs the arpent, and that one plot had shortly before fetched
15,000 francs per arpent.</p>

</a> In 1873, two years later, the price mounted as high
as 1000 francs; while in 1880, owing to the yield being far below an
average one and the quality promising to be exceedingly good, the wine
was bought up before the grapes were pressed at prices ranging from 1100
to 1400 francs the pièce.</p>

</a> In one of these, dated 1243, mention is made of the
&lsquo;vinea parva&rsquo; belonging to the Abbey of Avenay, and of the &lsquo;vineam
Warneri in loco qui dicetur Monswarins,&rsquo; perhaps the existing clos
Warigny. In another of Philip the Fair, dated 1300, and confirming the
abbey in the possession of property purchased from Jeanne de Sapigneul,
we read of &lsquo;unam vineam dictam la grant vigne domine Aelidis sitam
en Perrelles&rsquo; and &lsquo;unam vineam dictam a la Perriere.&rsquo; In charters of
the fourteenth century vineyards are mentioned at Avenay and Mutigny,
under the titles of Les Perches, Haut-Bonnet, Praëlles, Les Foissets,
Fond de Bonnet, Berard, Chassant, &amp;c. One sold to the abbey in 1334 by
Guillaume de Valenciennes was at a spot then, as now, styled Plantelles.
In 1336 the justices at Château-Thierry confirmed the Abbess, Madame
Clémence, in the &lsquo;droit de ban vin&rsquo;&mdash;that is, the right of selling her
wine before any one else in the territory of Avenay. This was again
confirmed in 1344 by the Bailly of Sézanne, who held that she alone had
the right of selling during the month after Christmas, the month after
Easter, and the month after Pentecost. Amongst other records is one
noting the condemnation of Perresson Legris, clerk, of Avenay, who was
sentenced in 1460 by the Bailly of Epernay to a fine of 60 sols, for
selling his wine during the month after Christmas without permission of
the Dames d&rsquo;Avenay. The charters of the fifteenth century also abound
in references to vineyards, or &lsquo;droits de vinage,&rsquo; appertaining to the
abbey at Les Coutures, Champ Bernard, Auches, Bois de Brousse, Thonnay,
&amp;c., in the territory of Avenay, and Les Charmières, Torchamp, Saussaye,
&amp;c., at Mutigny.</p>

</a> In 1668, an epoch at which the wines of Avenay had
acquired a high reputation, the abbey owned 43 arpents of vineland at
Avenay, Mutigny, and Mareuil, yielding the preceding year 200 poinçons
of wine, the sale of which produced 6000 livres. It also had 13
pressoirs banaux, which were farmed for 50 poinçons of wine, and tithes
of wine at Mareuil amounting to 14 poinçons and 460 livres in money, and
at Ambonnay amounting to 3 poinçons, the total of 67 poinçons fetching
1206 livres. The valet who looked after the vines had 50 livres per
annum, and the cooper who looked after the wines, 40 livres. The total
cost of stakes, manure, culture, pruning, wine-making, and casks was
2700 livres per annum. Ten pièces of wine &lsquo;of the best of the abbey,
and worth 300 livres,&rsquo; were annually given away in caques and bottles
to &lsquo;persons of quality and friends of the house, and travellers of
condition who pass;&rsquo; whilst 120 poinçons, valued at 3000 livres, were
consumed at the abbey itself. The abbey was partially destroyed by fire
in 1754; and its destruction was completed during the Revolution, at
which epoch its vineyards yielded a net revenue of 2500 livres.</p>

</a> In addition to Madame de la Marck, who was connected,
by the marriage of one of her brothers to a princess of the house of
Bourbon, with Henri Quatre, and to whose influence with that monarch
the execution of the &lsquo;Traité des Vendanges&rsquo; was mainly due, the roll
of the Abbesses of Avenay comprises several illustrious personages,
amongst them St. Bertha; Bertha II., daughter of the Emperor Lothaire;
the ex-Empress Teutberga; Bénédicte de Gonzague, daughter of the Duke
de Nevers, and sister of the Princess Palatine, who took such an active
part during the troubles of the Fronde; and ladies of the illustrious
families of Saulx Tavannes, Craon, Levis, Beauvillers, Brulart de
Sillery, Boufflers, &amp;c. M. Louis Paris, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de l&rsquo;Abbaye
d&rsquo;Avenay</cite>, gives some curious instances of the exercise of the &lsquo;haut
et basse justice&rsquo; possessed by these ladies. In 1587, under the rule
of Madame de la Marck, we find the Bailly of Avenay, acting as &lsquo;first
magistrate of Madame l&rsquo;Abbesse,&rsquo; sentencing one man and four women
&lsquo;to be hung, strangled, and burnt, and the goods belonging to them
confiscated to the profit of the Lady Justiciary,&rsquo; for the crime of
sorcery. In 1645 we find a &lsquo;sentence of the Bailly of Avenay against
Simeon Delacoste, accused and convicted of the crime of homicide
committed upon the person of Jean Bernier, and for this condemned to be
hung and strangled by the executioner on a gallows erected in the public
market-place, with confiscation of 300 livres, to be levied on his
goods, to the profit of the Lady Justiciary.&rsquo; When the criminal could
not be caught, as was the case with Nicholas Thimot, vine-grower at
Avenay in 1555, the sentence ran that he should &lsquo;be hung in effigy, and
his goods confiscated to the profit of Madame.&rsquo;</p>

</a> In Arthur Young&rsquo;s time (1787&ndash;9) an arpent of vineyard at
Hautvillers, valued at 4000 livres, yielded from two to four pièces, or
hogsheads, of wine, which sold from 700 to 900 livres the queue (two
pièces). This is more than the wine would ordinarily realise to-day,
although in years of scarcity it has fetched 700 francs the pièce, and
in 1880 as much as 1000 francs.</p>

</a> Cazotte, ex-Commissary-General of the Navy and author of
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Diable Amoureux</cite>, who was guillotined as a Royalist in 1792, had
a magnificently fitted mansion at Pierry. He distinguished himself by
his opposition to the pretensions of the Abbey of Hautvillers, which
in 1775 claimed the right of taking tithes at Pierry not only in the
vineyards, but on the wine in the cellars. Cazotte argued that unless
the monks chose to take their due proportion of grapes left for them
at the foot of each vine, all they were entitled to was a monetary
commutation of the tithe; for the wine being usually made of grapes
from a dozen different sources, many of them beyond their domain, it
would be impossible to ascertain the proportion that was their due.
The Parliament of Paris decided, however, that the abbey might take
the fortieth of the wine a month after it was barrelled, unless the
vine-growers preferred to give them the fortieth part of all the grapes
brought to the press. The fact was that the monks really wished to check
the practice of mixing grapes from different districts at the press,
for fear wine equal to their own should result from this plan, first
satisfactorily put in practice by Dom Perignon. Arthur Young mentions
that an arpent of vines at Pierry was valued at 2000 livres, half the
price the same extent commanded at Hautvillers.</p>

my friend Taissy,&rsquo; answered Sully, &lsquo;who sends it to me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then I must be
introduced to him,&rsquo; said the King; which was accordingly done. The wines
of Taissy had a high reputation as late as the eighteenth century. They
were classed by St. Evremond and Brossette, the commentator of Boileau,
amongst the best vintages of the Champagne, and their reputation was
maintained by the care bestowed by the Abbé Godinot on the vineyards
which he owned here.</p>

</a> This was far from being the first appearance of the pest
in this district. From 1779 to 1785 similar ravages drove the vignerons
to despair; but the weather during the last-named year suddenly turning
wet and cold, just at the epoch of the butterflies emerging from their
chrysalids, the evil disappeared as though by enchantment, an event duly
acknowledged by parochial rejoicings and religious processions. In 1816
similar ravages took place; and from 1820 to 1830 the pyrale also caused
great devastation.</p>

<p>In the year 1613, Jehan Pussot, the local chronicler of Reims, notes
that a large proportion of the vines were destroyed by &lsquo;a great
concourse of worms,&rsquo; which attacked those plants which the frost had
spared. This would establish that either the pyrale or the cochylis
was known to the Champenois viticulturists at the commencement of the
seventeenth century.</p>

</a> In 1873, in all the higher-class vineyards, as much as
two francs and a quarter per kilogramme (11&thinsp;<i>d.</i> per lb.) were paid,
being more than treble the average price. And yet the vintage was a most
unsatisfactory one, owing to the deficiency of sun and abundance of wet
throughout the summer. The market, however, was in great need of wine,
and the fruit while still ungathered was bought up at most exorbitant
prices by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spéculateurs</i> who supply the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin brut</i> to the Champagne
manufacturers.</p>

<p>In 1874 the grapes of the Mountain sold from at 55 to 160 francs the
caque, according to the crus; and those of the Côte d&rsquo;Avize at from 1
f. 25 c. to 2 f. per kilogramme. In 1875, on the other hand, grapes
could be obtained at Verzenay, Verzy, Ambonnay, and Bouzy at from 45 to
55 francs the caque; and at Vertus, Le Mesnil, Oger, Grauves, Cramant,
and Avize, at from 40 to 70 centimes the kilogramme. By far the highest
price secured by the growers for their grapes was in 1880, when the
produce of the grand crus of the Mountain fetched as much as 220 f. the
caque, equal to nearly 3 f. 60 c. the kilogramme, or about 1&thinsp;<i>s.</i> 5&thinsp;<i>d.</i>
per lb. It was, as usual, scarcity rather than quality that caused this
unprecedented rise in price.</p>

</a> M. Mauméné relates in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité du Travail des Vins</cite>
that on one occasion, when, as an experiment, 3000 first-class bottles,
which had already been used, were employed anew, only fifteen or sixteen
of the whole number resisted the pressure. Moreover, if much broken
glass is remelted down and used in the manufacture, the bottles do not
turn out well, the second fusion of silicates never having the same
cohesion as the first. The glass-works of Sèvres and Bercy, which melt
down most of the broken glass collected in Paris, have never been able
to supply bottles strong enough for sparkling wines.</p>

</a> It is calculated that wine, the grape sugar in which
yields ten per cent of alcohol, according to the average in Champagne,
would, if bottled immediately after pressing, produce enough carbonic
acid gas to develop a pressure of thirty-two atmospheres. But such a
pressure is never developed, as the wine is not bottled directly it
leaves the press; besides which no bottle could stand it. From four to
six atmospheres insure a lively explosion and a brisk creamy foam. It is
necessary, therefore, that fermentation should have been carried on till
at least three-fourths of the sugar have been converted into alcohol and
carbonic acid gas before the wine is drawn off for bottling, for even
the very best bottles burst under a pressure of eight atmospheres.</p>

<p>A few words on the origin and development of the effervescent properties
of Champagne will not be out of place here. These are due, as already
explained, to the presence of a large quantity of carbonic acid gas,
the evolution of which has been prevented by the bottling of the wine
prior to the end of the alcoholic fermentation. The source of carbonic
acid gas exists in all wines, and they may be all rendered sparkling by
the same method of treatment. Still, no effervescent wine can compare
with the finest growths of the Champagne, for these possess the especial
property of retaining a large portion of their sugar during, and even
after, fermentation; besides which, the soil imparts a native bouquet
that no other wine can match.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid gas is one of the two products of the fermentation of
grape sugar, the other being alcohol. In wine fermented in casks it
rises to the surface, and escapes through the bunghole left open for the
purpose. The case is different with wine fermenting in bottles tightly
secured by corks. Part of the gas developed rises into the chamber or
vacant space left in the bottle, where, mingling with the atmospheric
air, it exercises a constantly increasing pressure on the surface of the
wine. This pressure at length becomes so strong as to keep all the gas
subsequently formed dissolved in the wine itself, which it saturates,
as it were, and thereby converts into sparkling wine. Upon the bottle
being opened, the gas accumulated in the chamber rushes into the air,
producing a slight explosion, or pop, and freeing from pressure the gas
which had remained dissolved in the wine, and which in turn escapes in
the shape of numberless tiny bubbles, forming the foam so pleasing to
the eye on rising to the surface.</p>

<p>Sometimes on opening a bottle of Champagne the pop is loud, but the
effervescence feeble and transitory; and, on the other hand, there
is merely a slight explosion, and yet the wine froths and sparkles
vigorously and continuously. The two bottles may contain the same
quantity of gas, but in the one there is more in the chamber and
less dissolved in the wine, and hence the loud pop and slight
sparkle; while in the other the pressure is low, and the explosion
consequently slighter, but there is more gas in the wine itself, and
the effervescence is proportionately greater and more lasting. In the
former case the wine has received the addition of, or has contained from
the outset, some matter calculated to diminish its power of dissolving
carbonic acid gas, and is unsuitable for making good sparkling wine.
The nature of the effervescence is one of the best tests of the quality
of the wine. Gas naturally dissolved does not all escape at once on the
removal of the pressure, but, on the contrary, about two-thirds of it
are retained by the viscidity of the wine. The better and more natural
the wine, the more intimately the carbonic acid gas remains dissolved in
it, and the finer its bubbles.</p>

<p>The form of the glass out of which Champagne is drunk has an influence
on its effervescence. The wine sparkles far better in a glass
terminating in a point, like the old-fashioned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flûte</i>, or the modern
goblet or patera, with a hollow stem, than in one with a rounded bottom.
The reason is that any point formed around the liquid, as instanced in
the pointed bottoms of these glasses, or in the liquid, as may be proved
by putting the end of a pointed glass rod into the wine, favours the
disengagement of the gas. Powder of any kind presents a number of tiny
points, and hence the dropping of a little powdered sugar into Champagne
excites effervescence. Porous bodies like bread-crumbs produce the same
effect. Even dust has a similar action; and the wine will froth better
in a badly-wiped glass than in one perfectly clean, though it would
hardly do to put forward such an excuse as this for using dirty goblets.</p>

<p>The lively pop of the cork is less esteemed in England than in certain
circles in France, where many hosts would be sadly disappointed if the
wine they put before their guests did not go off with a loud bang,
causing the ladies to scream and the gentlemen to laugh. A brisk foam,
too, is absolutely necessary for the prestige of the wine, and &lsquo;grand
mousseux&rsquo; is a quality much sought after by the general public on the
other side of the Channel. It is not rare to meet with wines of a high
class in which the removal of the cork produces a loud explosion; but
unfortunately the brisk report and sharp but transitory rush of foam are
features easily imparted by artificial means. The ordinary white wines
of Lorraine and other provinces receive a certain addition of spirit
and liqueur, and are then artificially charged with carbonic acid gas
obtained from carbonate of lime, chalk, and similar materials, after the
fashion in which soda-water is made. These wines, sold as Champagne,
eject their corks with a loud pop, but three-fourths of the carbonic
acid gas escape at the same time, and the wine soon becomes flat and
dead; whereas a naturally sparkling wine of good quality left open for
three hours and then recorked will be found fresh and drinkable the next
day.</p>

<p>Both the explosion and the subsequent effervescence are aided by a high
temperature, which assists the development of the gas. Cold has the
opposite effect, and iced wine neither pops nor sparkles. It, however,
retains, if genuine, the whole of the carbonic acid gas held dissolved,
which is not the case with the imitations spoken of.</p>

<p>Were it not that the question has been seriously started on more than
one occasion, and only solved to the satisfaction of the questioner by a
chemico-anatomical explanation, it would hardly be worth while touching
upon the supposed hurtfulness of the carbonic acid gas contained
in sparkling wines. The fact of accidents frequently occurring in
breweries, distilleries, wine-presses, &amp;c., from the accumulation of
this gas, to breathe which for a few seconds is mortal, has led some
people to wonder how Champagne, whilst containing so large a proportion
of it, can be swallowed with impunity. The gas, however, which produces
fatal results when inhaled into the lungs, by depriving the blood of
the oxygen which it should find there, has in the stomach a beneficial
effect, serving to promote digestion. In drinking Champagne it is
conveyed direct to this latter region, so that no danger whatever
exists, any more than in the mineral waters.&mdash;Mainly condensed from E.

</a> For a long time the most erroneous ideas as to the cause
of such breakage and the means of preventing it prevailed. Tasting,
which was most relied on for ascertaining how far fermentation had gone,
could not be depended upon with accuracy, though the rule of thumb laid
down by some makers was that the time to bottle with the least risk of
breakage was when the sweet taste had disappeared, and vinous flavour
developed itself. The aerometers subsequently introduced failed to
answer the purpose, because the saccharine matter was not the only thing
capable of influencing them. The result usually was either the bottling
of a must so full of effervescence as to break the bottles, or of wine
already completely fermented and incapable of effervescing at all.</p>

</a> In some establishments tables made after the same fashion
replace the racks, whilst another plan of coaxing the sediment down
towards the cork is to stack the bottles at the outset in double rows,
with their necks inclining downwards, laths placed between each layer
maintaining them in their position. This method effects a great economy
of time and space, the bottles requiring on an average only a few days
on the racks prior to shipment to thoroughly complete the operation.</p>

</a> As the real origin of this system is a matter which has
excited no small amount of controversy, and as several claimants to the
honour of its discovery have had their names put forward by different
writers, the following extracts from a letter from M. Alfred Werlé, of
the house founded by Madame Clicquot, may serve to render honour where
it is really due: &lsquo;Already, in 1806 (I am unable to speak of an earlier
period with absolute certainty), the bottles were placed on tables,
like to-day, with their heads downwards; each bottle being taken out
of its hole, raised in the air, and shaken with the hand, so as to
cause the cream of tartar and the deposit it contained to fall upon the
cork, the holes being round, and the bottles placed straight downwards.
This lasted till 1818, when a man named Müller, an employé of Madame
Clicquot, suggested to her that the bottles should be left in the table
whilst being shaken, and that the holes should be cut obliquely, so
that the bottles might remain inclined. He maintained that one would
thus obtain a wine of far greater limpidity. The trial was made, and
every day, with a view of keeping this new process a secret, Müller and
Madame Clicquot shut themselves up alone in the cellars, and shook the
bottles unperceived. In 1821 Müller was assisted by a workman named
Mathieu Binder; and in 1823 or 1824, Madame Clicquot having purchased
from M. Morizet a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i> of wine which was shaken and prepared in
this merchant&rsquo;s cellars, one of his employés named Thomassin became
acquainted with the new method, and resolved to practise it; since
when it gradually spread, and eventually was generally adopted. M.
Werlé senior recollects perfectly well that when he arrived at Madame
Clicquot&rsquo;s in 1821 it was only at her establishment that the bottles
were shaken in this manner. The practice of shaking the bottles was a
very old one, and no more invented by Müller than by Thomassin; but the
former certainly effected great improvements by employing the system of
oblique holes, and shaking the bottles in the table and not in the air.&rsquo;</p>

or alum has been added to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuvée</i> at the time of fining, the deposit
is certain to be granular and non-adherent. But he justly remarks that
these solutions, especially the latter, though doing good to the wine,
have a precisely opposite effect upon the human stomach that consumes
it.</p>

</a> The high favour in which sugar-candy is held for mixing
with this Champagne liqueur dates from the latter part of the last
century, when there was a perfect mania for everything in a crystallised
form, as being the height of condensation and purity. The competition
between the first houses of Reims and Epernay to secure the largest and
finest crystals was very keen, and it was considered disgraceful for
any firm of standing to make use of sugar-candy of a yellow tinge or in
small crystals. Latterly it has been demonstrated that these expensive
crystals contain more water and less saccharine matter than an equal
weight of loaf-sugar, and that they sometimes contain a glutinous
element capable of imparting an insipid flavour to the wine.&mdash;Mauméné&rsquo;s

been found to resist rust, but is too expensive; whilst an experiment

</a> Victor Fievet&rsquo;s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire d&rsquo;Epernay</cite>. In the list of
expenses incurred on the passage of Louis XVI. and his family, four
hundred livres are set down to &lsquo;the Sieur Memmie Cousin, innkeeper and
merchant at Epernay, for the dinner of the king, the queen, and the
royal family, as well as for an indemnity for the furniture broken at
the said Cousin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As regards the price of the wines of the River during the Revolutionary
epoch, an old account-book of Messrs. Moët &amp; Chandon shows that in 1797
the firm paid for the white wine of Epernay and Avize 200 francs, for
that of Chouilly 180 francs, and for that of Pierry and Cramant 150
francs per pièce; whilst that of Ay cost from 565 to 600 francs the
queue. Bottles in 1790 only cost 16 livres 10 sols the hundred.</p>

</a> The Clos St. Pierre is now the property of M. Charles

</a> Cazotte, writing in October 1791, speaks of the village
as peopled with &lsquo;gros propriétaires;&rsquo; and in November, that it had
&lsquo;thirty-two households of well-to-do people.&rsquo; Amongst its inhabitants
were the Marquis Tirant de Flavigny, Dubois de Livry, Quatresols de la
Motte, De Lastre d&rsquo;Aubigny, De Lantage, &amp;c., most of whose residences
are still extant. In October 1792 several accusations were made against
soldiers for picking and eating grapes in the vineyards of Pierry and
Moussy, belonging to Cazotte, De la Motte, De Lantage, D&rsquo;Aubigny, &amp;c.</p>

</a> Arrested at Pierry in August 1792, in consequence of the
discovery, on the sacking of the Tuileries, of a new plan of escape for
the royal family, sent by him to his friend Ponteau, secretary of the
Civil List, Cazotte was brought to Paris and immured, in company with
his daughter Elizabeth, in the prison of the Abbaye. Arraigned before
the self-constituted tribunal presided over by the butcher Maillard, on
the night of the 3d September, the fatal words &lsquo;To La Force,&rsquo; equivalent
to a sentence of death, were pronounced; and Cazotte was about to fall
beneath the sabres already raised against him, when Elizabeth covered
his body with her own, and by her heroic appeals induced the assassins
to forego their prey. She even had the courage to drink with them to
the Republic, and with her father was escorted home in triumph. A few
days later, however, he was rearrested, condemned to death by the
Revolutionary Tribunal, and on the 25th September ascended the scaffold,
from whence he cried with a firm voice to the multitude, &lsquo;I die as I
have lived, faithful to God and my king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Under date of the 10 Prairial An II. (1793), the citizen Bourbon was
appointed by the municipality of Pierry to cultivate the vineyards &lsquo;du
gillotiné (<em>sic</em>) Cazotte.&rsquo;</p>

</a> In 1775 the Abbot of Hautvillers, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décimateur</i> of
Pierry, claimed to take tithe of a fortieth of all wines in the cellars
of the village. This claim being rejected by the baillage of Epernay
in 1777, he appealed to the Parliament of Paris. Cazotte undertook
the case of his fellow-proprietors, pleading that the abbey, which,
according to strict law, was bound to take the tithe in the shape of
grapes left at the foot of each vine, had long since replaced this
by a monetary commutation; and that the inhabitants of Pierry, like
the other wine-growers of the Champagne, being &lsquo;obliged, in order to
obtain perfection in their wines, to mix the grapes of several crus and
different tithings, it would be impossible to tithe the wine itself.&rsquo; He
also argued that the question had been settled by a decision on the same
point in favour of the inhabitants of Ay and Dizy. However, the monks
obtained a decree from parliament authorising them to take the fortieth
of the vintage a month after the wines had been barrelled, unless the
wine-growers preferred &lsquo;to pay the tithe at the wine-press, in form of
the fortieth load of grapes free from all mixture.&rsquo; The inhabitants
appealed in 1780, pleading the impossibility of this plan of tithing at
the press, on account of the expense and of the difficulty of sorting
out the grapes from those brought from Moussy, Vinay, Monthelon, Cuis,
Epernay, and other districts in which they had also vineyards. The
Revolution cut the Gordian knot of this affair, which really arose from
the wish of the monks to hinder as much as possible that plan of mixing
grapes from different sources, to which the perfection of their own wine
was due.</p>

</a> In January 1790 the inhabitants of Pierry unanimously
elected Cazotte their first mayor under the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>. A decree
signed by him in this capacity, and dated April 11, 1790, fixes the
price for a day&rsquo;s work in the vineyards at 12 sols. In 1793 the
municipality of the adjoining district of Moussy fixed the day&rsquo;s hire of
the vintager at 25 sous, of horses employed in the vintage at 7 livres
10 sous, and of asses at 5 livres. As regards the price of the local
cru, amongst the items of the accounts of the syndic of Moussy for the
years 1787&ndash;8 is the following: &lsquo;For thirteen bottles of stringed wine
(vin fisselé) sent to Paris to the procureur of the community (Failly
lawsuit), 13 livres.&rsquo; The community were then engaged in a lawsuit with
the Count de Failly respecting a wood. During the Revolutionary epoch it
was decreed by the municipality of Pierry that a vineyard known as les
Rennes should, on account of the resemblance to les Reines, be in future
styled les Sans-culottes. It has since resumed its old name.</p>

</a> The story of Cazotte prophesying not only his own fate,
but that of the king and queen, Condorcet, Bailly, Malesherbes, Nicolai,
the Duchess de Grammont, and others who perished during the Terror, at a
dinner given at an Academician&rsquo;s in 1788, has been proved to be a mere
invention on the part of La Harpe. Nevertheless there seems but little
doubt that he distinctly foresaw many coming evils; and a native of
Pierry, M. Armand Bourgeois, asserts that his maternal grandfather was
one day at Cazotte&rsquo;s house in the village, when the entire company were
completely upset by their host&rsquo;s prophecies of a coming revolution.</p>
